			<documentation>WPS Execute operation response. By default, this XML document is delivered to the client in response to an Execute request. If "status" is "false" in the Execute operation request, this document is normally returned when process execution has been completed.
			If "status" in the Execute request is "true", this response shall be returned as soon as the Execute request has been accepted for processing. In this case, the same XML document is also made available as a web-accessible resource from the URL identified in the statusLocation, and the WPS server shall repopulate it once the process has completed. It may repopulate it on an ongoing basis while the process is executing.
			However, the response to an Execute request will not include this element in the special case where the output is a single complex value result and the Execute request indicates that "store" is "false". Instead, the server shall return the complex result (e.g., GIF image or GML) directly, without encoding it in the ExecuteResponse. If processing fails in this special case, the normal ExecuteResponse shall be sent, with the error condition indicated. This option is provided to simplify the programming required for simple clients and for service chaining. </documentation>
