(Spatial) data harmonisation with the HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor

The HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor (HALE) enables you to transform and harmonise spatial data, with a focus on highly complex data sets. HALE can be used for defining and evaluating conceptual schema mappings, to create logically and semantically consistent mappings. Furthermore, HALE documents the schema transformation process and its impact on data quality.
