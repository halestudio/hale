	<h1>Map perspective</h1>
	<p>The map perspective features a map view that displays the
		geometries contained in the data, provided that the corresponding
		coordinates reference systems are known.</p>

	<p>Following is a short description of the perspective's views:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <i>Map</i> view provides you with a cartographic
			representation of the data. Source and transformed data are displayed
			alongside each other, with different layouts to choose from. The map
			can be used to select instances for examination in the data views, or
			vice versa.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Source Data</i> view displays samples of the loaded
			source data. A filter query can be used to control which instances
			are displayed.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Transformed Data</i> view displays samples of the
			transformed data. By default it is synchronized to the <i>Source
				Data</i> view and contains the transformation result of the instances
			represented there.
		</li>
	</ul>
