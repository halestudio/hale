/**
 * A Transition is a special type of {@link Relation} that could be described as
 * activatable. While a normal relationship is something static (such as a 
 * Woman is-a Human), a transition allows a concept to be transformed into 
 * another by executing an activity, such as Union(A,B) -> C.
 * Transitions can be used to automatically construct workflows in cases where
 * the constraints set in a {@link MediatorComplexRequest} cannot be satisfied from
 * already computed products but need to be processed from more basic products. 
 * While being a {@link Relation}, a Transition at the same time also represents a 
 * "virtual" {@link Concept}.
 * 
 * A Transition does not have a direct counterpart in ISO 19110, but similar 
 * ideas can be found in some Ontology languages where they are sometimes called
 * functions.
