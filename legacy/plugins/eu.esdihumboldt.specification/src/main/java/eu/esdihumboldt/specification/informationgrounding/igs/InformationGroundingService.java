/**    
* Name: eu.esdihumboldt.informationgrounding.igs / InformationGroundingService<br/>    
* Purpose: This interface describes methods used to find Geospatial information resources distributed on the Internet.
* They are the called Grounding Services. 
* For this purpose this interface provides methods to find information about {@link GroundingService} 
* which fulfill several imposed constraints and to manage the {@link GroundingCatalogue} 
* where these Grounding Services are metadated.<br/>    
*   
* Note that for an implementation in the Mediator, this Service should consist  
* of a local service for local information groundings as well as a remote   
* service which represents the actual catalogue of available services and  
* data sources.  
*
