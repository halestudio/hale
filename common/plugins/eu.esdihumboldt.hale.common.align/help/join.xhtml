	<h1>Join transformation</h1>
	<p>The join transformation can be used to map multiple source types
			to one target type.</p>
	<div id ="help">
		<h2>
			<a name="order">Join order</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			The first step for creating a join transformation is to select the
			order of the source types. For each instance of the topmost type a
			target instance will be created. The following types will be joined in
			order to fill the result with additional information. This can also
			result in several instances of the second type for one particular
			instance of the first type. The third type then can have several
			instances matching one of those instances of the second type (or the
			first type again depending on the <a href="#condition">conditions</a>)
			and so on.

		<h2>
			<a name="condition">Conditions</a>
		</h2>
		<p>Each type after the first needs at least one join condition on
			the previous types. It can have conditions on only one of the previous
			types but it may also have conditions on several of them. Conditions
			are simple equalities. A property of the joined type is compared to
			the selected property of a base type. If all these conditions are
			equal the instance is used. A particular instance may match more than
			one instance of the previous types and will then be used each time.</p>

		<p>To create a condition, select a property on the left and on the
			right side, then click on the button in the middle.</p>

			<a name="condition">Index Join Handler (experimental)</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			To activate the use of the Index Join Handler for all Join and Groovy
			Join transformations, set the Java system property <code>hale.functions.use_index_join_handler</code>
			or the environment variable <code>HALE_FUNCTIONS_USE_INDEX_JOIN_HANDLER</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Index Join Handler is experimental and can potentially have a
			negative impact on the performance of Join and Groovy Join transformations.
