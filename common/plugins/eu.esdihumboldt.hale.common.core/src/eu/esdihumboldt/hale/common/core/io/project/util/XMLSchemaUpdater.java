	 * Reads the given xml schema (resource) and searches for included and
	 * imported schemas in the file. If these files are local, the function
	 * tries to copy the resources into a new directory next to the given schema
	 * (resource) and adapts the dependencies in the resource. The oldFile is
	 * the path of the xml schema before it was copied to his new directory (eg.
	 * temporary directory). The oldFile keeps untouched. Resource has to be a
	 * copy of oldFile. <br>
	 * <br>
	 * Example:<br>
	 * resource file is 'C:/Local/Temp/1348138164029-0/watercourse/wfs_va.xsd' <br>
	 * oldFile is 'C:/igd/hale/watercourse/wfs_va.xsd'.<br>
	 * wfs_va.xsd has one schema import with location
	 * 'C:/igd/hale/watercourse/schemas/hydro.xsd'<br>
	 * So hydro.xsd is copied into 'C:/Local/Temp/1348138164029-0/watercourse/'
	 * (or a subdirectory) and the import location in wfs_va.xsd will be
	 * adapted.<br>
	 * Resources only will be copied once. In this case the schema location is
	 * solved relative to the originally schema.
	 * 
	 * @param resource the file of the new resource (will be adapted)
	 * @param oldFile the file of the old resource (will be untouched)
	 * @param includeWebResources true if web resources should be copied and
	 *            updated too otherwise false
	 * @param reporter the reporter of the current I/O process where errors
	 *            should be reported to
	 * @throws IOException if file can not be updated
