<h2>Styling of your Data</h2>

On the top left corner of the Map View you can find
the settings for controlling the map rendering. Specifically,
you can configure so-called Styled Layer
Descriptors there, using a rich GUI. Click on the
Styles button, select the <i>FeatureType</i> for which
you want to define a styling, and then configure your
styling rule. You can define styles for points, lines
and polygons, and you can define complex styles
with filter rules. It's also possible to define a style for
selected Features.
<br>
It is also possible to load a styling from a XML Styled
layer Descriptor file. Using this feature to load a predefined
styling for the transformed data allows to get
a live impression in the Map Viewer of the progress
of your mapping endeavour.
