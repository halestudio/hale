<h2>Terminology</h2>

The term <i>alignment</i> refers to the complete set of relationships
defined between two conceptual schemas.
A <i>mapping</i> is an individual relationship between entities
of the source and the target schema.
A <i>conceptual schema</i> is the model used for a data
set and can be expressed in a different conceptual
schema languages, such as a GML Application
Schema, as an XML Schema (XSD), as a UML model
or as a SQL DDL. Even shapefiles contain a
simple model for attributive data.
Please note that throughout this documentation, the
term <i>FeatureType</i> is used synonymously to Spatial
Object Type (INSPIRE wording) and Concept (Ontology
Engineering).
<i>Attribute</i> and <i>Property</i> are used synonymously. Both
refer to elements of a type definition, sometimes also
called fields. Usually, a Property represents a complex
field, i.e. one that is not of a primitive type such
as a String or number.
