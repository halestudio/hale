<h2>Troubleshooting Schema Loading</h2>

In case an error message pops up during schema
loading or a schema doesn't appear after loading,
some problem occurred in parsing it. Most of the
time, these issues are due to referenced schemas
not being accessible. This is e.g. the case when your
schema references online resources, e.g. from
<a href="http://schemas.opengis.net">http://schemas.opengis.net</a>, but you currently don't
have a connection. Also, you might have relative
paths in the schema locations used that are not valid
on your machine. <br>
Another issue that frequently prevents loading of
schemas is the presence of a <b>proxy server</b>. If your
network requires the usage of one, please configure
the proxy server setting by going to the Configure
Menu and clicking "Other Settings". Then select the
"Proxy Settings" page. Enter your HTTP proxy host
and port and click "Ok". If needed you can also
define credentials for the authentication to the proxy.
