Allow using the internal browser for displaying the help on Windows and
Mac OS X.
On some Linux systems the JVM may crash when the help browser based on
SWT is used, so the configuration is separated into OS specific fragments.

IMPORTANT: This fragment needs to be available prepackaged in the target
platform, because the PDE build won't build the fragments on its own. As such,
changes made here must be in snych with the packaged fragment in the target
platform!
