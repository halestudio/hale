<h2>Troubleshooting source data loading</h2>

If you have problems loading GML data, try using another
parser configuration. If you get an error message
that complains about a Spatial Reference System
that is not known to the application, use the Additional
CRS preference page (available through
Configure -> Other settings) to register the Well
Known Text of the missing reference system.
HALE currently supports loading of GML 2.1 and
GML 3.1/3.2 source data. Furthermore, GML which
uses Application Schemas that redefine core elements
such as FeatureCollection also often
give issues in loading. If you have issues with loading
a GML file, please provide us with feedback on
the issue.
Also please note that many existing WFS implementations
have a few peculiarities. HALE has been
tested with the following products:
<ul> 
	<li>GeoServer - OK</li>
	<li>MapServer - OK</li>
	<li>CubeWerx WFS - OK</li>
	<li>ESRI - OK when Schema References are
		repaired (by default they are often broken</li>
	<li>GeoMedia - Fails because of coordinate
		formatting issues and redefinition of FeatureCollection</li>
</ul>
