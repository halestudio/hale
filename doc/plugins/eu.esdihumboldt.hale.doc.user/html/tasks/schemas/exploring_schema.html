<h2>Exploring a loaded Schema</h2>

HALE comes with a powerful schema explorer view.
This view presents the content of the loaded schemas
in a tree view. In the default representation, the
schema elements that have been loaded are organized
by their extension (or inheritance) hierarchy. In
the case of a GML Application Schema, this means
that directly under the namespace element, an entry
for <i>AbstractGmlObject</i> and/or <i>AbstractFeatureType</i>
is created, depending on the GML version
you are using. Below this entry, you'll find your
types extending <i>AbstractFeatureType</i>.
If your schema contains complex element declarations
that do not extend <i>AbstractFeatureType</i>, these
are interpreted as so-called <i>PropertyTypes</i>.
When you expand a Feature or Property Type by
clicking on the + or arrow (depending on your operating
system) in front of its name, its subtypes and attributes
will be shown to you. For the attributes additionally
to the property name also their type name is
shown, e.g. <i>&lt;string&gt;</i>. A type name that includes a
question mark (e.g. <i>&lt;?&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;? extends boolean&gt;</i>)
states that this is an anonymous type declared especially
for the given attribute.
Some attributes represented in the schema tree are
marked with a special sign in addition to their classification
symbol. The default geometry of a feature
type is marked with a green triangle (<img alt="" src="./../../../images/triangle.jpg">), items that
represent attributes in XML (in contrast to elements)
are marked with a brown arrow (e.g. <img alt="" src="./../../../images/arrow.jpg">) and mandatory
attributes are marked with a red asterisk (e.g.<img alt="" src="./../../../images/asterisk.jpg">).
<br>
You can also deactivate the organisation by inheritance
by clicking the first icon on the top of the respective
schema explorer. Your types will then be shown in a
list instead of a tree. Pressing the button
again will restore the tree presentation.
There are two additional ways of extending the tree
or the list:
<ul> 
	<li><i>Expand complex properties</i>: In the case of
		complex application schemas, attributes are
		often complex types themselves. Enabling
		this option will expand these properties, so
		that you can inspect their structure.
	</li>
	<li><i>Repeat inherited properties</i>: With this option
		enabled, all properties that a type inherits
		are also displayed under it again, not just
		under the type that declared the properties.
		This is a helpful option if you want to define
		specific mapping rules for each subtype instead
		of defining them on the supertype.
	</li>
</ul>
In addition to extending the representation, there are
also several filters you can apply to limit the information
presented to you. The most obvious one is the
filtering by element name. Just enter a string corresponding
to the name of the element you are looking
for, and the tree will be updated to show only the elements
matching your query. To remove this filter,
press the eraser icon on the right side of the filter text
field.
Furthermore, you can filter the properties that are
displayed by their type:
<ul>
	<li><i>Hide Abstract Types</i>: This will hide types
		that are declared as abstract.
	</li>
	<li><i>Hide Property Types</i>: This will hide/show
		types that are no FeatureTypes.
	</li>
	<li><i>Hide String Types</i>: This will hide/show any
		property with a String binding.
	</li>
	<li><i>Hide Numeric Types</i>: This will hide/show
		any property with a numeric (integer, floating point) type of binding.
	</li>
	<li><i>Hide Geometry Types</i>: This will hide/show
		any property that has a Geometry binding.
	</li>
</ul>

You can also get detailed information about any element
of a schema by right-clicking on it in the
schema explorer and then selecting "Properties". The
dialogue appearing then contains any annotations
that have been defined on the type, provides information
on the binding and also on other properties,
such as its cardinality. It also lists allowed values in
case of an enumeration type of property.
All options above can also be combined. As an example,
selecting the "List" organisation mode together
with "repeat inherited properties" and "Hide Property
types" will give you a list of the abstract and concrete
FeatureTypes, each one with their full attribute
set. Use Hide Abstract Types in addition and you'll
get a list of only the concrete types, each one with all
its properties.
