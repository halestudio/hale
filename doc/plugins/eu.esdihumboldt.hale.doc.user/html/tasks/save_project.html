	<h1>Saving your work</h1>
	<p>
		<i>HALE</i> allows you to save your mapping, together with the
		configuration which schemas and source data sets are used in an
		alignment project. The project also includes additional settings, e.g.
		the list of mapping relevant types and the map styles. You can
		continue working on a project later on, by loading it again in the
		application.
	</p>
	<!-- TODO alignment export? -->
	<p>
		To save a project, use the <i>Save Alignment Project as...</i> command
		in the <i>File</i> menu or the application tool bar. Recently saved or
		loaded projects are available in the <i>File</i> menu and on the
		welcome page for quick access, for loading another project you can use
		the <i>Open Alignment Project</i> command.
