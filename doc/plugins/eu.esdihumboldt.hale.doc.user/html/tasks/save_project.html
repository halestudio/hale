	<h1>Saving your work</h1>
	<p>
		<i>hale»studio</i> allows you to save your mapping, together with the
		configuration which schemas and source data sets are used in an
		alignment project. The project also includes additional settings, e.g.
		the list of mapping relevant types and the map styles. You can
		continue working on a project later on, by loading it again in the
		application.
	</p>
	<!-- TODO alignment export? -->
	<p>
		To save a project, use the <i>Save Alignment Project as...</i> command
		in the <i>File</i> menu or the application tool bar. Recently saved or
		loaded projects are available in the <i>File</i> menu and on the
		welcome page for quick access, for loading another project you can use
		the <i>Open Alignment Project</i> command.
	</p>
	<p>There are four different formats for projects currently supported:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <b>hale project</b> (.hale) contains the project
			configuration and the alignment in a single file. The (.hale) format is deprecated and only kept for backwards compatibility.
		</li>
		<li>A <b>hale XML project</b> (.halex) saves the project as an
			XML file, with the alignment as a separate file. This is the best
			choice if you use your projects with any kind of version control.
		</li>
		<li>A <b>hale project archive</b> (.halez) is a ZIP archive
			including the project file, alignment and all local resources. Online
			resources can be included as well. The project archive is the best
			choice for sharing a project. It can be turned into a hale XML
			project by simply extracting the archive.
		</li>
		<li>With a <b>hale connect transformation project</b> you can upload
			your project including the alignment and all local resources to
			the collaboration platform <a href="https://www.haleconnect.com">hale»connect</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
