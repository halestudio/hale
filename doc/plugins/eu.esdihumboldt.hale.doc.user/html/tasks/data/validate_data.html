	<h1>Validate the transformed data</h1>
	<p>If you target a specific schema it is vital for your
		transformation result to not only follow the schema's structure, but
		to also meet the other constraints defined by the schema, like
		mandatory properties or restrictions on property values.</p>
	<p>Validation of instances in <i>hale studio</i> currently is supported for XML
		based schemas. Validation can be done on the exported transformation
		result or on the transformed instances currently available in the
		application.</p>
	<p>In addition to schema-based checks, <i>hale studio</i> supports validation of the
		exported transformation result with Schematron. To perform Schematron
		validation, you can add the Schematron validator to the list of
		validators and configure it when exporting the transformed instances.
		Alternatively, you can load Schematron schemas permanently into the
		project. Validation will then be performed by the Project validator
		which is enabled in the export wizard by default.</p>

	<h2>Validation of exported data</h2>
	<p>When exporting data or transforming external data you have the
		option to specify which validators should be executed as soon as 
		writing the data to the output file is finished. Each validator 
		produces a report about errors found during the validation and 
		informs you whether the file is valid or not.</p>

	<h2>Validation inside hale studio</h2>
	<p>If a mapping exists and source data is loaded, each mapping change will 
		trigger the live transformation (if activated).
		When the transformed data changes, schema-based validation is started
		automatically to validate the instances. Live validation can be enabled
		and disabled in the main menu or via the tool bar:</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/validation_activate.png" class="fit">
	</div>
	<p>A status item in the lower right corner of the <i>hale studio</i> window shows
		the status of the validation. If there is a small warning sign in the
		icon, it informs us about validation errors:</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/val_status_2.png" class="fit">
	</div>
	<p>
		Clicking on the status item opens the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/views/report_list.html">Report
			List</a> and selects the last validation report.
	</p>
	<div>

	<p>
		If the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/views/properties.html">Properties
			view</a> is not yet shown, you can open it by double-clicking on the
		report. If there were problems during the validation you will see the
		<em>Warnings</em> section in the report's properties. There the
		validation warnings are listed, grouped by the property where they
		occur. If there are many warnings for a property, only a few are
		displayed, because usually they originate from the same problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can inspect the instances for which these warnings were generated
		by double-clicking on a warning message or a property. The transformed
		data view is opened, and the instance associated to the message or the
		instances with problems for this property are displayed. Please note
		that this action <em>pins</em> the Properties view, so it show the
		report information even if another view is selected.

	<p>This kind of validation inside <i>hale studio</i> is very convenient, but may
		not be as accurate as the validation on export for some cases. This is
		due to the fact that the export itself may change the result slightly
		from what is available in hale studio. This could for instance be encodings
		that are only replied when writing certain properties, or values like
		identifiers that are generated when missing.</p>
