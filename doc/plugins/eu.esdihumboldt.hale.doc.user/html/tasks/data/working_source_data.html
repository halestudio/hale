<h2>Working with a source data set</h2>

The term "source data" or "instance data" always
refers to an actual geographic data set whose entries
represent objects and are modelled using one of the
loaded schemas, be it target or source.
To load an source data set , go to "File" -> "Open
Source Data". In the wizard which opens, you can
again choose whether to import data from a WFS or
from a local GML file (*.shp support will be added
soon). If you would like to load from a local GML file,
click on "... file" and press the "Browse..." button. Select
the file you want to use, press "Open" and then
"Finish". Loading the file usually takes several
seconds (typically around 3-6 per Megabyte).
There are different parser configurations available for
loading GML data. Select the appropriate configuration
(GML 2, GML 3 or GML 3.2) for your data set.
To import source data from a WFS, pick the option
"WFS GetFeature". Enter the GetCapabilities URL of
your WFS in the entry field at the top of the form that
appears. When HALE succeeds in parsing
the capabilities, the "Next" button is enabled.
Press the "Next" button and pick a
namespace as well as the FeatureType of
the Features that you would like to import.
Note that the namespace of the loaded
source schema must match the
namespace of the loaded source data, otherwise
you will not be able to continue. Finally,
you can also define filters on the
source data, such as spatial filters or filters
on alphanumerical properties. The exact
filters you can define depend on the capabilities
of the WFS you are working with.
If the system cannot clearly identify the
used SRS from the data, it will request the user to
provide either the EPSG code or the Well-Known
Text for the used SRS.
