	<h1>Transformation via the command line</h1>
	<p>This help topic is about performing transformation of source
		data using the command line interface provided by HALE. It allows you
		to execute transformations based on mappings defined in HALE, without
		having to use HALE as desktop application, for instance to run the
		transformation automatically on a regular basis or to integrate it
		with existing infrastructure.</p>
	<p>The following are the basic things you need to use the command
		line interface:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>An existing <b>HALE project file</b>, e.g. a project archive (.halez).</li>
		<li>The location of the <b>source data to transform</b>, either an URL or a file name. The data has to match the source schema of the project.</li>
		<li>Configuration on <b>how and where to write the transformed data</b>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>General usage</h2>
	<p>You can run HALE on the command line either using the HALE
		executable (e.g. HALE.exe) or using Java directly. Depending on the
		operating system, behavior may be different, but in general it is
		better to use Java directly (but make sure you have a compatible
		version of Java installed), especially if you include the task in an
		automated process. The advantage of using the HALE executable is that
		it uses the Java version that is shipped with HALE automatically. The following are
		the commands to show the usage information of the command line interface, with the
		executable or via Java, assuming your working directory is the HALE
		installation folder:</p>
	<p>Running the HALE executable:</p>
	<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> <i>HALE -nosplash</i> -application hale.transform</code></pre>
	<p>Running Java:</p>
	<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> <i>java -jar plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.0.v20140415-2008.jar</i> -application hale.transform</code></pre>
	<p>
		Running the command above will show the usage information of the
		transformation application. Please note that for the Java call, the
		version of the launcher JAR file may change with new HALE versions.
		For simplicity, the following examples will use the
		<code>HALE</code>
		executable, you can substitute HALE by the call to Java as above.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that every argument before
		<code>-application</code>
		and after the executable or JAR file is a <b>launcher argument</b>,
		every argument after
		<code>hale.transform</code>
		is an <b>application argument</b>.
	</p>
	<p class="Note">
		<b>Note:</b>
		If using the HALE executable on Windows you will probably want to add the <code>-console</code> launcher argument as well:
		<code>HALE -nosplash -console -application hale.transform</code><br>
		Otherwise you may get no feedback from the application (if you still get no feedback, launch via Java).
	</p>
	<p class="Note">
		<b>Note:</b> If using a version of HALE installed with the Windows
		installer (or generally a version of HALE that has no write access to
		its directory) it is needed to specify a data location with the
		additional launcher argument
		<code>-data</code>
		, for instance like this:
		<code>HALE -nosplash -console -data "%APPDATA%\dhpanel\HALE"
			-application hale.transform</code>
	</p>
	<h3>Configuration parameters</h3>
	<p>The following is the usage information provided by the transformation application:</p>
	<pre><code>HALE -nosplash -application hale.transform
     -project &lt;file-or-URI-to-HALE-project&gt;
     -source &lt;file-or-URI-to-source-data&gt;
         [-providerId &lt;ID-of-source-reader&gt;]
         [&lt;setting&gt;...]
     -target &lt;target-file&gt;
         [-preset &lt;name-of-export-preset&gt;]
         [-providerId &lt;ID-of-target-writer&gt;]
         [&lt;setting&gt;...]
     [-validate &lt;ID-of-target-validator&gt; [&lt;setting&gt;...]]
     [options...]

  where setting is
     -S&lt;setting-name&gt; &lt;value&gt;
     -X&lt;setting-name&gt; &lt;path-to-XML-file&gt;

  and options are
     -reportsOut &lt;reports-file&gt;
     -stacktrace
     -trustGroovy</code></pre>
	<h4>HALE project file</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-project &lt;file-or-URI-to-HALE-project&gt;</code></pre>
	<p>
		A HALE project contains all the necessary information to perform the
		transformation from one data model into another. It references the
		source and target schemas and describes the transformation rules in
		the aligment.<br> Use the
		<code>-project</code>
		parameter to provide the location to your project file, as a relative
		or absolute path, or as a URI.
	</p>
	<p>If you want to share your project, the best option is to save it
		as a project archive. In the save wizard you can specify to include
		online resources to make it loadable offline. You can also exlude any
		source data from the project, which will be ignored for command line
		transformation anyway.</p>
	<div>Here are some examples on how you can provide paths to a project file on Windows: 
		<ul>
			<li><code>-project C:\Hale-Project\myProject.halez</code> (absolute path)</li>
			<li><code>-project myProject.halez</code> (relative path)</li>
			<li><code>-project "C:\Hale-Project\my Project.halez"</code> (quoted absolute path with spaces)</li>
			<li><code>-project http://hale.igd.fraunhofer.de/templates/resources/files/example-inheritance-hydro/project.halex</code> (URL)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h4>Source data</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-source &lt;file-or-URI-to-source-data&gt; [-providerId &lt;ID-of-source-reader&gt;] [&lt;setting&gt;...]</code></pre>
	<p>The source data you can as well provide as path to a file or a
		URI. For instance you can provide a URI to a Web Feature Service
		GetFeature request. Specifying a source data location is mandatory,
		any source data configured in the HALE project will be ignored for the
		transformation.</p>
	<p>
		You can transform data from multiple sources if you provide a
		<code>-source</code>
		argument for each.
	</p>
	<p>HALE will try to guess the file format and how to read it, so in
		most cases it will be enough to specify the location of the source
		data. But you also have the possibility to control in detail which
		HALE data reader to use and how to configure it.</p>
	<p>
		Please take a look at the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.ioproviders/overview/InstanceReader.html">InstanceReader
			reference</a> to see what kind of providers are available for you and what
		kind of configuration options they offer. <i>Please note that this
			reference documentation is generated from the I/O providers present
			in your local HALE installation (including eventual additional
			plugins and custom implementations), so it is <b>only available in the
			local HALE help and not in the online version on the web</b>.</i>
	</p>
	<h4>Transformation result</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-target &lt;target-file&gt; [-preset &lt;name-of-export-preset&gt;] [-providerId &lt;ID-of-target-writer&gt;] [&lt;setting&gt;...]</code></pre>
	<p>
		Also you need to specify where to write the transformation result to.
		Usually this is a file.<br>In addition you need to provide either
		an export preset or a HALE data writer ID and configuration.
	</p>
	<p>
		The recommended approach is to use an export preset. You can easily
		define it in HALE with support through the UI, and save it as part of
		the project. An export preset essentially stores the configuration
		information on how to save the data. Create it in HALE via <i>File</i>&#8594;<i>Export</i>&#8594;<i>Create
			custom data export...</i> in the main menu. Configure the export and
		specify a name for the preset - this name is what you specify to use
		the preset on the command line.
	</p>
	<div>
		For example, if you created a preset named <code>GML</code> you can use it for the transformation like this:
		<pre class="cli"><code>-target output.gml -preset GML</code></pre>
	</div>
	<p>Even when using a preset, you can still provide setting parameters to override specific behavior.</p>
	<p>
		Please take a look at the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.ioproviders/overview/InstanceWriter.html">InstanceWriter
			reference</a> to see what kind of providers are available for you and what
		kind of configuration options they offer. <i>Please note that this
			reference documentation is generated from the I/O providers present
			in your local HALE installation (including eventual additional
			plugins and custom implementations), so it is <b>only available in the
			local HALE help and not in the online version on the web</b>.</i>
	</p>
	<h4>Validation</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-validate &lt;ID-of-target-validator&gt; [&lt;setting&gt;...]</code></pre>
	<p>The transformation result can optionally also be validated. To
		do so, specify a validator to use by its ID in HALE. For example to
		validate a created XML/GML file against it's XML Schema Definition use:</p>
	<pre><code>-validate eu.esdihumboldt.hale.io.xml.validator</code></pre>
	<p>
		Please take a look at the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.ioproviders/overview/InstanceValidator.html">Instance
			validators</a> reference to see what kind of validators are available
		for you and what kind of configuration options they offer. The
		validator will by default be configured with the content type of the
		transformation result writer. <i>Please note that this reference
			documentation is generated from the I/O providers present in your
			local HALE installation (including eventual additional plugins and
			custom implementations), so it is <b>only available in the local
				HALE help and not in the online version on the web</b>.
		</i>
	</p>
	<h4>Other options</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt><code>-reportsOut &lt;reports-file&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies the location of a report file to be written. The report file will hold
			information on the different tasks executed during the transformation
			process, e.g. the data import, the transformation, the data export or
			the validation. Use this option if you want to know in detail what
			kind of warnings or errors may have occurred during the execution of
			these tasks. If you find the file format hard to read, import the
			report log into the <i>Report List</i> view in HALE.
		</dd>
		<dt><code>-stacktrace</code></dt>
		<dd>Provide this flag to enable printing the stacktrace if
			launching the transformation process fails due to an internal error
			or misconfiguration. Please note that this does not encompass errors
			that occur as part of the transformation tasks as stated above - use
			the report file for information on those.</dd>
		<dt><code>-trustGroovy</code></dt>
		<dd>Provide this flag if you trust any Groovy transformation
			functions used in the provided project. This will lift restrictions
			on Groovy calls and speed up the execution.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Here is an example on how to use the command line interface. There is a 
	HALE project named <code>toInspire.halez</code> which contains a source schema 
	and a mapping one of the INSPIRE application schemas. The source data is contained 
	in the <code>geographicData.shp</code> file, which is encoded in <code>UTF-8</code>. The transformed 
	data should be stored in <code>inspireData.gml</code> and as GML with an INSPIRE SpatialDataSet as container.</p>
	<div>
		Using a previously defined preset <code>SpatialDataSet</code>
		<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> HALE -nosplash -application hale.transform -project toInspire.halez -source geographicData.shp -Scharset UTF-8 -target inspireData.gml -preset SpatialDataSet</code></pre>
	</div> 
	<div>
		Specifying writer and settings explicitly
		<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> HALE -nosplash -application hale.transform -project toInspire.halez -source geographicData.shp -Scharset UTF-8 -target inspireData.gml -providerId eu.esdihumboldt.hale.io.inspiregml.writer -Sinspire.sds.namespace http://gdi-de.org/oid/de.beispiel.namespace -Sinspire.sds.localId 10</code></pre>
	</div>
