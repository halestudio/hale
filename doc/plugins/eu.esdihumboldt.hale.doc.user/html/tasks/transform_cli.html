	<h1>Transformation via the command line</h1>
	<p>This help topic is about performing transformation of source
		data using the command line interface provided by <i>hale studio</i>. It allows you
		to execute transformations based on mappings defined in <i>hale studio</i>, without
		having to use <i>hale studio</i> as desktop application, for instance to run the
		transformation automatically on a regular basis or to integrate it
		with existing infrastructure.</p>
	<p>The following are the basic things you need to use the command
		line interface:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>An existing <b>hale project file</b>, e.g. a project archive (.halez).</li>
		<li>The location of the <b>source data to transform</b>, either an URL or a file name. The data has to match the source schema of the project.</li>
		<li>Configuration on <b>how and where to write the transformed data</b>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>General usage</h2>
	<p>You can run <i>hale studio</i> on the command line either using the <i>hale studio</i>
		executable (i.e. HALE.exe) or using Java directly. Depending on the
		operating system, behavior may be different, but in general it is
		better to use Java directly (either use locally installed compatible
		version of Java or the version shipped with <i>hale studio</i>), especially if you
		include the task in an automated process. The advantage of using the
		<i>hale studio</i> executable is that it uses the Java version that is shipped with
		<i>hale studio</i> automatically and sets some important system properties for you.
		The following are the commands to show the usage information of the
		command line interface, with the executable or via Java, assuming your
		working directory is the <i>hale studio</i> installation folder:</p>
	<p>Running the <i>hale studio</i> executable:</p>
	<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> <i>HALE -nosplash</i> -application hale.transform</code></pre>
	<p>Running Java:</p>
	<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> <i>java -Xmx1024m -Dcache.level1.enabled=false -Dcache.level1.size=0 -Dcache.level2.enabled=false -Dcache.level2.size=0 -jar plugins\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.0.v20140415-2008.jar</i> -application hale.transform</code></pre>
	<p>Running the command above will show the usage information of the
		transformation application. Please note that for the Java call, the
		version of the launcher JAR file may change with new <i>hale studio</i> versions and
		you should use a path delimiter appropriate for your system.</p>
	<p>Additionally, the Java call specifies settings and system
		properties for the Java VM. You cannot provide these settings to a
		call to the <i>hale studio</i> executable - in that case you have to adapt the file
		<code>HALE.ini</code>. Following is a short description of the most important
		VM arguments:</p>
	<ul>
		<li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><code>-Xmx1024m</code><br><br>This setting specifies the
			<b>maximum heap memory</b> provided as working memory for <i>hale studio</i>. If you are
			with very large individual instances you may need to increase the
			value. The example specifies a maximum heap space of 1024 MB.</li>
		<li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><code>-Dcache.level1.enabled=false
				-Dcache.level1.size=0 -Dcache.level2.enabled=false
				-Dcache.level2.size=0</code><br><br>These settings are important for the
			temporary database used within <i>hale studio</i>. If you do not use them you may
			run into memory issues.</li>
		<li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><code>-Dlog.hale.level=INFO -Dlog.root.level=WARN</code><br><br>These
			settings allow you to <b>configure the log level</b> for log events emitted
			by <i>hale studio</i>. These log events may overlap with messages from the reports,
			but are generally independent. <code>log.hale.level</code> controls
			the log level for components of <i>hale studio</i>, while <code>log.root.level</code>
			controls the log level for other code, such as third party libraries.
			See the <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html"
			target="_blank">logback documentation</a> for more information on
			logging levels and other details about the logging configuration.</li>
		<li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">If you need <i>hale studio</i> to <b>connect to the internet via a
				proxy server</b>, you need to provide that information as system
			properties as well. The command line interface will not read the
			proxy settings you configured in the <i>hale studio</i> user interface.<br><br>
			The following system properties can be provided to configure the proxy:
			<ul>
				<li><code>http.proxyHost</code> - the proxy host name or IP address</li>
				<li><code>http.proxyPort</code> - the proxy port number</li>
				<li><code>http.nonProxyHosts</code> - hosts for which the proxy should not be used, separated by | (optional)</li>
				<li><code>http.proxyUser</code> - user name for authentication with the proxy (optional)</li>
				<li><code>http.proxyPassword</code> - password for authentication with the proxy (optional)</li>
			</ul>
			Specifying the system properties for configuration of the proxy could look like in this example:<br>
			<code>-Dhttp.proxyHost=webcache.example.com -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080
-Dhttp.nonProxyHosts="localhost|host.example.com"</code><br><br>
			More information on proxy configuration in Java can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html">here</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For simplicity, the following examples will use the
		<code>HALE</code>
		executable, you can substitute <code>HALE</code> by the call to Java as above.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that every argument before
		<code>-application</code>
		and after the executable or JAR file is a <b>launcher argument</b>,
		every argument after
		<code>hale.transform</code>
		is an <b>application argument</b>.
	</p>
	<p class="Note">
		<b>Note:</b> As an alternative to using the <i>hale studio</i> application to
		launch the CLI, you can use the dedicated <a
			href="https://github.com/halestudio/hale-cli" target="_blank">hale-cli</a>.
		With <i>hale-cli</i> a transformation is called like this:<br>
		<code>hale transform &lt;arguments...&gt;</code>
		<br> <i>hale-cli</i> also offers other kinds of commands and can
		be extended with custom functionality via an extension point.
	</p>
	<p class="Note">
		<b>Note:</b>
		If using the <i>hale studio</i> executable on Windows you will probably want to add the <code>-console</code> launcher argument as well:
		<code>HALE -nosplash -console -application hale.transform</code><br>
		Otherwise you may get no feedback from the application (if you still get no feedback, launch via Java).
	</p>
	<p class="Note">
		<b>Note:</b> If using a version of <i>hale studio</i> installed with the Windows
		installer (or generally a version of <i>hale studio</i> that has no write access to
		its directory) it is needed to specify a data location with the
		additional launcher argument
		<code>-data</code>
		, for instance like this:
		<code>HALE -nosplash -console -data "%APPDATA%\dhpanel\HALE"
			-application hale.transform</code>
	</p>
	<h3>Configuration parameters</h3>
	<p>The following is the usage information provided by the transformation application:</p>
	<pre><code>HALE -nosplash -application hale.transform
     [-argsFile &lt;file-with-arguments&gt;]
     -project &lt;file-or-URI-to-HALE-project&gt;
     -source &lt;file-or-URI-to-source-data&gt;
         [-include &lt;file-pattern&gt;]
         [-exclude &lt;file-pattern&gt;]
         [-providerId &lt;ID-of-source-reader&gt;]
         [&lt;setting&gt;...]
     [-filter &lt;filter-expression&gt;]
     [-filterOn &lt;type&gt; &lt;filter-expression&gt;]
     [-excludeType &lt;type&gt;]
     [-exclude &lt;filter-expression&gt;]
     -target &lt;target-file-or-URI&gt;
         [-preset &lt;name-of-export-preset&gt;]
         [-providerId &lt;ID-of-target-writer&gt;]
         [&lt;setting&gt;...]
     [-validate &lt;ID-of-target-validator&gt; [&lt;setting&gt;...]]
     [options...]

  where setting is
     -S&lt;setting-name&gt; &lt;value&gt;
     -X&lt;setting-name&gt; &lt;path-to-XML-file&gt;

  and options are
     -reportsOut &lt;reports-file&gt;
     -stacktrace
     -trustGroovy
     -overallFilterContext
     -statisticsOut &lt;statistics-file&gt;
     -successEvaluation &lt;file-or-URI-to-script&gt;</code></pre>
	<h4>hale project file</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-project &lt;file-or-URI-to-hale-project&gt;</code></pre>
	<p>
		A hale project contains all the necessary information to perform the
		transformation from one data model into another. It references the
		source and target schemas and describes the transformation rules in
		the aligment.<br> Use the
		<code>-project</code>
		parameter to provide the location to your project file, as a relative
		or absolute path, or as a URI.
	</p>
	<p>If you want to share your project, the best option is to save it
		as a project archive. In the save wizard you can specify to include
		online resources to make it loadable offline. You can also exlude any
		source data from the project, which will be ignored for command line
		transformation anyway.</p>
	<div>Here are some examples on how you can provide paths to a project file on Windows: 
		<ul>
			<li><code>-project C:\Hale-Project\myProject.halez</code> (absolute path)</li>
			<li><code>-project myProject.halez</code> (relative path)</li>
			<li><code>-project "C:\Hale-Project\my Project.halez"</code> (quoted absolute path with spaces)</li>
			<li><code>-project http://hale.igd.fraunhofer.de/templates/resources/files/example-inheritance-hydro/project.halex</code> (URL)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h4>Source data</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-source &lt;file-or-URI-to-source-data&gt; [-providerId &lt;ID-of-source-reader&gt;] [&lt;setting&gt;...]</code></pre>
	<p>The source data you can as well provide as path to a file or a
		URI. For instance you can provide a URI to a Web Feature Service
		GetFeature request. Specifying a source data location is mandatory,
		any source data configured in the hale project will be ignored for the
		transformation.</p>
	<p>
		If the source is a directory, you can specify multiple
		<code>-include</code>
		and
		<code>-exclude</code>
		parameters to control which files to load. If you do not specify
		<code>-include</code>
		, it defaults to
		<code>"**"</code>
		, i.e. all files being included, even if they are in sub-directories.
		Patterns use the <a target="_blank"
			href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-">glob
			pattern syntax as defined in Java</a> and should be quoted to not be interpreted by the shell.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can transform data from multiple sources if you provide a
		<code>-source</code>
		argument for each.
	</p>
	<p><i>hale studio</i> will try to guess the file format and how to read it, so in
		most cases it will be enough to specify the location of the source
		data. But you also have the possibility to control in detail which
		hale data reader to use and how to configure it.</p>
	<p>
		Please take a look at the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.ioproviders/overview/InstanceReader.html">InstanceReader
			reference</a> to see what kind of providers are available for you and what
		kind of configuration options they offer. <i>Please note that this
			reference documentation is generated from the I/O providers present
			in your local <i>hale studio</i> installation (including eventual additional
			plugins and custom implementations), so it is <b>only available in the
			local <i>hale studio</i> help and not in the online version on the web</b>.</i>
	</p>
	<h4>Filtering source data</h4>
	<p>By default <i>hale studio</i> uses all data passed in as sources for the
		transformation. The filter options allow you to filter the source data
		before it is passed to the transformation. This can be helpful for
		selecting only objects actually needed for the transformation (e.g. to
		reduce processing time and temporary storage used), or to exclude
		objects that would falsify the result.</p>
	<p>
		With
		<code>-filter</code>
		you can specify a filter expression that is checked against all
		objects read from the source. The filter language can be specified at
		the beginning of the filter expression, followed by a colon. If no
		language is provided explicitly, the expression is assumed to be CQL.
		Following a simple example filter only accepting instances with the
		value 'Berlin' for the property
		<code>name</code>:
	</p>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-filter "CQL:name = 'Berlin'"</code></pre>
	<p>
		To apply a filter only to objects of a certain type use
		<code>-filterOn</code>
		. The first argument to
		<code>-filterOn</code>
		is the type. You can specify it's name with or without namespace. If
		you want to specify the namespace, wrap it in curly braces and prepend
		it to the type name (for example:
		<code>{namespace}name</code>
		). The second argument is the filter expression that is to be applied
		to that type.
	</p>
	<p>
		If filters are defined, generally, any object needs to be accepted by
		at least one of the filters defined with
		<code>-filter</code>
		or
		<code>-filterOn</code>
		. If there are only filters for specific types (
		<code>-filterOn</code>
		), and no general filters defined, objects of other types pass without
		check.<br>Exception to that are only the exclusion filters.
		<code>-excludeType</code>
		and
		<code>-exclude</code>
		prevent an instance to be passed to the transformation even if they
		were accepted by a different filter.
	</p>
	<p>
		<code>-excludeType</code>
		will prevent any instance of a specific type from being passed to the
		transformation.
		<code>-exclude</code>
		on the other hand allows specifying a filter. Only instances that
		don't match the filter pass on to the transformation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The argument
		<code>-overallFilterContext</code>
		is another filter related option. If you pass this flag to the call,
		it is ensured that any context aware filters share a context across
		loading all of the defined sources. Context aware filters can right
		now only be supplied in Groovy.
	</p>
	<h4>Transformation result</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-target &lt;target-file-or-URI&gt; [-preset &lt;name-of-export-preset&gt;] [-providerId &lt;ID-of-target-writer&gt;] [&lt;setting&gt;...]</code></pre>
	<p>
		Also you need to specify where to write the transformation result to.
		Usually this is a file.<br>In addition you need to provide either
		an export preset or a hale data writer ID and configuration.
	</p>
	<p>
		The recommended approach is to use an export preset. You can easily
		define it in <i>hale studio</i> with support through the UI, and save it as part of
		the project. An export preset essentially stores the configuration
		information on how to save the data. Create it in <i>hale studio</i> via <i>File</i>&#8594;<i>Export</i>&#8594;<i>Create
			custom data export...</i> in the main menu. Configure the export and
		specify a name for the preset - this name is what you specify to use
		the preset on the command line.
	</p>
	<div>
		For example, if you created a preset named <code>GML</code> you can use it for the transformation like this:
		<pre class="cli"><code>-target output.gml -preset GML</code></pre>
	</div>
	<p>Even when using a preset, you can still provide setting parameters to override specific behavior.</p>
	<p>
		Please take a look at the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.ioproviders/overview/InstanceWriter.html">InstanceWriter
			reference</a> to see what kind of providers are available for you and what
		kind of configuration options they offer. <i>Please note that this
			reference documentation is generated from the I/O providers present
			in your local <i>hale studio</i> installation (including eventual additional
			plugins and custom implementations), so it is <b>only available in the
			local <i>hale studio</i> help and not in the online version on the web</b>.</i>
	</p>
	<h4>Validation</h4>
	<pre class="cli"><code>-validate &lt;ID-of-target-validator&gt; [&lt;setting&gt;...]</code></pre>
	<p>The transformation result can optionally also be validated. To
		do so, specify a validator to use by its ID in hale. For example to
		validate a created XML/GML file against it's XML Schema Definition use:</p>
	<pre><code>-validate eu.esdihumboldt.hale.io.xml.validator</code></pre>
	<p>
		Please take a look at the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.ioproviders/overview/InstanceValidator.html">Instance
			validators</a> reference to see what kind of validators are available
		for you and what kind of configuration options they offer. The
		validator will by default be configured with the content type of the
		transformation result writer. <i>Please note that this reference
			documentation is generated from the I/O providers present in your
			local <i>hale studio</i> installation (including eventual additional plugins and
			custom implementations), so it is <b>only available in the local
				<i>hale studio</i> help and not in the online version on the web</b>.
		</i>
	</p>
	<h4>Other options</h4>
	<dl>
		<dt><code>-reportsOut &lt;reports-file&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies the location of a report file to be written. The report file will hold
			information on the different tasks executed during the transformation
			process, e.g. the data import, the transformation, the data export or
			the validation. Use this option if you want to know in detail what
			kind of warnings or errors may have occurred during the execution of
			these tasks. If you find the file format hard to read, import the
			report log into the <i>Report List</i> view in <i>hale studio</i>.
		</dd>
		<dt><code>-stacktrace</code></dt>
		<dd>Provide this flag to enable printing the stacktrace if
			launching the transformation process fails due to an internal error
			or misconfiguration. Please note that this does not encompass errors
			that occur as part of the transformation tasks as stated above - use
			the report file for information on those.</dd>
		<dt><code>-trustGroovy</code></dt>
		<dd>Provide this flag if you trust any Groovy transformation
			functions used in the provided project. This will lift restrictions
			on Groovy calls and speed up the execution.</dd>
		<dt><code>-statisticsOut &lt;statistics-file&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>
			Specifies the location of a file to write the transformation statistics to.
			The transformation statistics are saved as JSON.
			They contain aggregated information on the different tasks that were run as part of the transformation.
		</dd>
		<dt><code>-successEvaluation &lt;file-or-URI-to-script&gt;</code></dt>
		<dd>
			This option allows you to customize the behavior of the transformation command in respect to if a run is interpreted as successful or not.
			The script you can specify here is a Groovy script that is evaluated against the transformation statistics.
			The script is expected to be encoded in UTF-8.
			You can use the <code>-statisticsOut</code> parameter to get an idea of the contents of the statistics.<br>
			A success evaluation script could for example look like this:<br>
			<pre><code>// the transformation must have been completed
assert aggregated['eu.esdihumboldt.hale.transform'].report.completed == true
// without errors
assert aggregated['eu.esdihumboldt.hale.transform'].report.errors == 0

// there must have been objects created as part of the transformation
assert aggregated['eu.esdihumboldt.hale.transform'].createdPerType.any { name, count -> count > 0 }</code></pre>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Here is an example on how to use the command line interface. There is a 
	hale project named <code>toInspire.halez</code> which contains a source schema 
	and a mapping one of the INSPIRE application schemas. The source data is contained 
	in the <code>geographicData.shp</code> file, which is encoded in <code>UTF-8</code>. The transformed 
	data should be stored in <code>inspireData.gml</code> and as GML with an INSPIRE SpatialDataSet as container.</p>
	<div>
		Using a previously defined preset <code>SpatialDataSet</code>
		<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> HALE -nosplash -application hale.transform -project toInspire.halez -source geographicData.shp -Scharset UTF-8 -target inspireData.gml -preset SpatialDataSet</code></pre>
	</div> 
	<div>
		Specifying writer and settings explicitly
		<pre class="cli"><code><b>&gt;</b> HALE -nosplash -application hale.transform -project toInspire.halez -source geographicData.shp -Scharset UTF-8 -target inspireData.gml -providerId eu.esdihumboldt.hale.io.inspiregml.writer -Sinspire.sds.namespace http://gdi-de.org/oid/de.beispiel.namespace -Sinspire.sds.localId 10</code></pre>
	</div>
