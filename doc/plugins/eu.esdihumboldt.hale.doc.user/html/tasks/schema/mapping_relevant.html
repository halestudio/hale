	<h1>How to customize the mapping relevant types</h1>
	<p>When dealing with complex schemas with various defined types, it
		can be very helpful for the mapping process, to just focus on the
		schema information that is relevant for the alignment. On the other
		hand, by default a type that is relevant for you might not have been
		classified as mapping relevant - in this case you would like to change
		the classification.</p>
	<p>
		Which types in a schema are classified as mapping relevant has various
		effects. For one, only the mapping relevant types are displayed in the
		<a href="../../views/schema_explorer.html">Schema Explorer</a> or can
		be used for creating a relation. Also, when loading source data,
		usually only instances of mapping relevant types are loaded.
	</p>
	<h2>Selecting mapping relevant types</h2>
	<p>You can customize the mapping relevant types for the source and
		target schema separately, the only precondition is that you have
		loaded the respective schema.</p>
	<p>
		The commands for configuring the mapping relevant types are available
		in the <i>Edit</i> menu and in the application tool bar. Choose <i>Edit
			mapping relevant source types</i> or <i>Edit mapping relevant target
			types</i> depending on which configuration you want to change.
	</p>
	<!-- TODO add command links? -->
	<p>A dialog will open that shows the complex types defined in the
		schema, grouped by namespace. Types that are already used in the
		alignment will not be shown, as these are mapping relevant per
		definition. For each type a checkbox is provided, that allows you to
		enable or disable its status as mapping relevant.</p>

	<h2>Removing a mapping relevant type</h2>
	<p>
		Classifying a type as not mapping relevant can also be done through
		the context menu of a selected type, e.g. in the <a
			href="../../views/schema_explorer.html">Schema Explorer</a>. In the
		context menu select the <i>Exclude type from mapping</i> command.
