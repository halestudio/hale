	<h1>Loading and browsing schemas</h1>
	<p>A first step to map schemas is to load them. In the current
		version of HALE, you can load any XML Schema, including metadata
		schemas, GML Application Schemas and others. However, the schema
		import is optimized for GML Application Schemas and supports the
		following versions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>GML 2.1</li>
		<li>GML 3.1</li>
		<li>GML 3.2</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		You can also load a schema from a shapefile (*.shp) or csv-file
		(*.csv). Schemas can either be loaded from a file or from a Web
		Feature Service's GetCapabilities and DescribeFeatureType operations.
		Please note that using GML Application Schemas with types extending <i>AbstractFeatureType</i>
		is the recommended method for HALE in the current version. Only when
		doing so, all transformation functions can be used. Such schemas can
		be created in multiple ways, e.g. from UML models by using Shapechange<sup>1</sup>
		or from databases and shape files using Geoserver<sup>2</sup>. It is
		also possible to use Safe's FME for this purpose. To load a schema, go
		to the "File" menu and click "Open Schema". In the dialogue that
		appears now, choose whether you want to import a schema to use as a
		source or as a target schema. Then, choose from which source to import
		by clicking the radio buttons in front of the "... file" and "...WFS"
		options. When you chose to import from a file, click the Button
		labelled "Browse..." and select the file you would like to import.
		Please note that only files with an extension that is either *.xsd,
		*.xml or *.gml will be shown. After doing so, press "Open" and then
		"Finish".
	</p>
	<p>Importing from a WFS works in a similar way. Press the
		"Change..." button and enter your server's Get- Capabilities request
		URL into the text field at the top of the appearing window. The
		correctness of the URL is automatically validated. If the validation
		is successful, you can contrinue by pressing the "Finish" button. All
		types will now be loaded and shown in a new wizard page. If your WFS
		offers Feature- Types from more than one namespace, you are now also
		required to pick one of the namespaces - HALE can always just work
		with one "main" namespace for the schema. Press "Use this WFS" and
		then again "Finish".</p>
	<p>When everything worked as it should have, you will now see the
		namespace of your schema in the left part of the Schema Explorer if
		you loaded a source schema, or in the right part if you selected to
		load a target schema.</p>
