<title>Identify type relations</title>

	<h1>Identify type relations</h1>
	<p>When creating a mapping the first steps usually are analyzing
		the source and target schema types, identifying correspondences
		between those types and creating corresponding relations. After this
		each type relation is given attention to in turn, for identifying
		the relations between the properties.</p>

	<h2>1. Identify relevant types</h2>
	<p>First you should identify which types are relevant for the
		mapping. The schemas may contain more types than are initially listed
		in the Schema Explorer, especially if you are working with XML
		Schemas.</p>
	<p>
		For the source the relevant types usually are those types you expect
		data to be present for and that contain information relevant for the
		target schema.<br> The relevant target types are those you wish
		to populate and that have related representations in the source
		schema.
	</p>
	<p>
		To specify the relevant types, use <i>Edit&#8594;Edit mapping
			relevant source types</i> and <i>Edit&#8594;Edit mapping relevant target
			types</i>. Take a look at <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/tasks/schema/mapping_relevant.html">How
			to customize the mapping relevant types</a> for more information.
	</p>
	
	<h2>2. Find type correspondences</h2>
	<p>
		With a type correspondence we refer to correspondences between source
		and target types. It needs to be identified, which types in the
		target schema are alike or somehow related to the types from the
		source schema.<br> A common way to identify correspondences is
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>to identify which (real world) objects each type represents,
			and</li>
		<li>to identity what information is needed to populate a target
			type instance and which source types hold that information.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		As an example, take the <i>River</i> source and <i>Watercourse</i>
		target type below. There is a clear correspondence there, as the
		concept of a Watercourse includes Rivers.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/type_ex_river_pre.png">
	</div>
	<p>There may be multiple correspondences for a type, and a single
		correspondence may involve multiple source types if the information of
		all of them has to be combined to provide the information needed to
		populated the target.</p>
		
	<h2>Conditional relations</h2>
	<p>
		Often correspondences are bound to certain conditions. As an example
		let's assume we have an <i>InlandWater</i> type defined in the source
		schema, with an attribute <i>type</i>. Values that can occur for the
		attribute are
		<code>river</code>
		,
		<code>canal</code>
		and
		<code>lake</code>
		. Only <i>InlandWaters</i> that are rivers or canals correspond to the
		target type <i>Watercourse</i> - so in this case the relation should
		only apply to a subset of <i>InlandWater</i>s. This can be realised by
		defining a condition context on the <i>InlandWater</i> type and use
		the context in the relation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Take a look at <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/tasks/schema/define_context.html">Defining
			contexts on schema elements</a> on how to create condition contexts. For
		the above example the context could be defined with this CQL
		condition:<br>
		<code>type = 'river' OR type = 'canal'</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		A defined context for a type appears next to it in the <i>Schema
			Explorer</i> and can be used just like a normal type for the mapping.
	</p>

	<h2>Identify each type relation</h2>
	<p>For the type correspondences as the next step you need to
		identify how they can be expressed as relations in <i>hale</i>.</p>
	<p>
		The most simple kind of relation is a 1:1 relation - a correspondence
		between a single source and a single target type, where all
		information needed to populate a target instance is present in a
		single source instance - like in our <i>River/Watercourse</i> example.
		This kind of relation is represented in <i>hale</i> by the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.cst.doc.functions/functions/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.align.retype.html">Retype</a>
		function.<br />
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/type_ex_river.png">
	</div>
	<p>
		If multiple instances of a single source type need to be combined to
		form a target instance, the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.cst.doc.functions/functions/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.align.merge.html">Merge</a>
		function is the right choice. If multiple source types are involved,
		use the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.cst.doc.functions/functions/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.align.join.html">Join</a>
		function to express the relation and configure how these source types
		are related to each other. A good practice in such cases is also to
		start with a <i>Retype</i> with the most relevant source type of the
		correspondence, and replace it with a <i>Join</i> later on.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you have identified a relation, create it by selecting the
		affected source and target types in the Schema Explorer, then select
		the <i>Select a mapping function</i> button between source and target
		schema and choose the appropriate function. See <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/tasks/alignment/mapping_schema_elem.html">Mapping
			schema elements</a> for more information on the creation of relations.
	</p>

	<p>For each type relation then the next step should be analyzing
		the properties of the involved source and target types and identifying
		correspondences and relations between those properties.</p>
