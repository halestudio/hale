	<h1>Editing a Mapping Cell</h1>
	<p>
		To edit an existing mapping cell, select it in the <a
			href="../../views/alignment.html">Alignment view</a> and either use
		the <i>Edit...</i> command in the context menu or the application's <i>Edit</i>
		menu.
	</p>

	</div>
	<p>Editing a cell will open the configuration wizard that also was
		used for creating the cell, allowing to change the input and output
		assignments and the parameters. Changing the relation type is not
		possible, for this you have to delete the cell and create a new one.</p>
