	<h1>Publishing a project</h1>
	<p>
		There are two ways to publish a transformation project on
		<i>hale connect</i>:
		<ul>
			<li>
				By <b>sharing</b> the project with the 
				<i>File</i>&#8594;<i>Share project...</i> command. This
				will export a snapshot of your current project to 
				<i>hale connect</i>.
			</li>
			<li>
				By <b>saving</b> the project to <i>hale connect</i>
				just like you would save to a local project file
				using <i>File</i>&#8594;<i>Save Alignment project as...</i>.
			</li> 
		</ul>
			
		In both cases you will be presented with the same wizard to complete
		project details before the upload to <i>hale connect</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the first screen of the wizard you are asked to provide the project 
		name, author and a description.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the next page you are requested to provide the export destination.
		In case you have not logged into <i>hale connect</i> before, you can 
		use the <i>Login</i> button on the screen shown below to log in.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can choose to either create a new project on <i>hale connect</i> 
		or update an existing one. In case the currently opened project
		was loaded from <i>hale connect</i>, updating the loaded project
		will be selected by default.
	</p>
	<p>
		You must also choose whether you will be the owner of the uploaded 
		project on <i>hale connect</i> or one of your organizations. You must
		select which of the organisations that you belong will own the uploaded 
		project via the dropdown. Note that only the first option is available 
		in cases where you are not allowed to add projects in the name of any of 
		your organizations.
