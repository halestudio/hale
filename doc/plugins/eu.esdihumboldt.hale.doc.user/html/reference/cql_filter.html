	<h1>CQL Filter</h1>
	<p>The Common Query Language (CQL) is used to define expressions
		and filters in several parts of HALE. It can be used to define
		conditions on schema elements or to filter instances.</p>
	<p>In a filter, you can refer to a property value by the property
		name. If you want to refer to a nested property, use a dot to separate
		the property names on the property's path.</p>
	<div></div>
	<p>Stating the namespace associated to a property name is optional,
		though it may be useful to differentiate between properties with the
		same local name. A namespace is specified by encapsulating it in XXX
		brackets and using it as a prefix for the corresponding property name.</p>
