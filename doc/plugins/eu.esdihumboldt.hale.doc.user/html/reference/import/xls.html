	<h1>Excel File (XLS, XLSX) Import</h1>
	<p>
		Excel files can be used as a data source in <i>hale studio</i>. The 
		schema definition can/should also be derived from this excel file, 
		by using a headline or user input to define attribute names.
	</p>
	<!-- sheet explain -->
	<h2>Schema import</h2>
	<p>
		This section provide information to the schema import process.
	</p>
	<h3>Sheet and structure of the sheet</h3>
	<p>
		The Excel file can have more than one sheet and you are able 
		to choose your sheet during the import process.
		The type name is declared using the sheet's name or by user input.
		Please notice, that the fist entry (headline entry or value) 
		should be presented in the upper left cell of your chosen sheet.
	</p>
	<!-- headline and attribute name -->
	<h3>Headline and attribute names</h3>
	<p>
		A headline defines the attribute names and is located at the top 
		of each column.
		It is possible to import a schema without a present 
		headline, because the attribute names can be declared during 
		the import process.
	</p>
	<!-- associated data type -->
	<h3>Data Type</h3>
	<p>
		It is possible to choose the value's type during the schema import 
		process. The type is checked against the present values of the 
		associated column, so you will get a notice if your choice is invalid.
	</p>
	<!-- data import -->
	<h2>Data import</h2>
	<p>
		During the source data import and if a headline is present, 
		the "Skip first line" option should be checked, preventing the 
		attribute names from being read as actual values.
		If you are using two different excel files, please make sure
		that the rows have the same structure. It is recommended to use 
		the same file.
