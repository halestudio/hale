	<h1>Shapefile Import</h1>
	<p>
		Shapefiles can be used as a data source in <i>HALE</i>, with the
		schema definition also being derived from the Shapefile. Before
		importing a Shapefile as source data, you have to import it as source
		schema.
	</p>
	<p>The schema derived from a Shapefile contains one main type
		representing the Shapefile, with properties according to the
		attributes available in the file. The type name is derived from the
		file name.</p>
	<p>When loading Shapefiles as data, the geometries are available as
		geometry objects, which can be displayed in the map view if they
		include the projection.</p>
