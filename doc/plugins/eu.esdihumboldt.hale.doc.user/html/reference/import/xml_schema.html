	<h1>XML Schema Import</h1>
	<p>
		<i>HALE</i> supports loading schemas from XML Schema Definition (XSD)
		files. XML elements and types will be analyzed in a given schema file,
		as well as in the included and imported additional schemas. Complex
		properties are supported, as well as cycles, substitutions, groups and
		choices.
	</p>
	<p>A restriction on the XML schema import is that only one XML
		schema can be loaded as source or target schema. If you want to load
		multiple XML schemas, please create a schema including or importing
		the XML schemas you want to combine. However, combining importing an
		XML schema with other types of schemas is possible.</p>
	<p>Initially, only types from the main schema will be classified as
		mapping relevant types, if you find any types missing, you can
		customize the list of mapping relevant types.</p>
