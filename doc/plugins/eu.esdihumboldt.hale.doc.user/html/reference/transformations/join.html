	<h1>Join transformation</h1>
	<p>The join transformation can be used to map multiple source types
		to one target type.</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="order">Join order</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The first step for creating a join transformation is to select the
		order of the source types. For each instance of the topmost type a
		target instance will be created. The following types will be joined in
		order to fill the result with additional information. This can also
		result in several instances of the second type for one particular
		instance of the first type. The third type then can have several
		instances matching one of those instances of the second type (or the
		first type again depending on the <a href="#condition">conditions</a>)
		and so on.

	<h2>
		<a name="condition">Conditions</a>
	</h2>
	<p>Each type after the first needs at least one join condition on
		the previous types. It can have conditions on only one of the previous
		types but it may also have conditions on several of them. Conditions
		are simple equalities. A property of the joined type is compared to
		the selected property of a base type. If all these conditions are
		equal the instance is used. A particular instance may match more than
		one instance of the previous types and will then be used each time.</p>
