	<h1>GML Data Export</h1>
	<p>
		The support for exporting GML is covered by the <a
			href="xml_data.html">XML Export</a>. For GML additionally the export
		format <i>GML (FeatureCollection)</i> is offered, which tries to
		determine the root element automatically, by looking for elements
		derived from GML <i>AbstractFeatureCollection</i>. If this doesn't
		work for you, you can still use the normal XML export and select the
		root element manually.
