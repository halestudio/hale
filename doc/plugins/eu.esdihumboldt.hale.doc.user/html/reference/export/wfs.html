	<h1>Transactional WFS</h1>
	<p><i>hale製tudio</i> supports publishing your transformed GML data to a WFS with
		support for transactions. Currently supported are Transactional Web
		Feature Services following the OGC WFS 1.1.0 or WFS 2.0.0
		specifications. There are two different providers for publishing to
		WFS:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>direct upload</strong> will do a single request
			that starts as soon as the first transformed features are available.
			Use this option if you are sure the WFS can cope with the amount of
			data in a single transaction.
		</li>
		<li>The <strong>partitioned upload</strong> partitions the
			transformed data before upload to be able to do multiple requests to
			the WFS-T for large data sets. There are three options for the way
			the data will be partitioned:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Keep instances that reference each other together</strong>:
					This is the default behaviour that used in previous versions of
					<em>hale製tudio</em>. The partitioning is done based on the references 
					between features. Features that are connected are kept together so the 
					WFS-T is able to retain those references.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Cut strictly at threshold</strong>:
					In this mode, the partitions will be cut exactly at the given threshold,
					without taking mutual referencing of instances into account.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="Note">The publishing to WFS in this version of <i>hale製tudio</i> is
		deemed experimental. This means it does not have the full
		functionality we want to provide for a WFS publishing feature.
		However, within its limits it is functional and may be useful to you.</p>
	<p>The publishing to WFS currently has the following known limitations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Non-fatal errors during the transformation or the GML
			encoding are ignored, the features published thus may be incomplete
			or missing specific information - please note the corresponding
			messages in the transformation and export reports. There is no
			automatic recovery, features may have to be deleted manually if they
			are not desired to be published.<br>
		<br><i>hale製tudio</i> behaves like this because both transformation and GML
			export aim to provide you a result even if there are small errors or
			inconsistencies.<br><br>
		</li>
		<li><i>hale製tudio</i> will not check the WFS Capabilities if the WFS
			supports any of the provided GML feature types.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Target location for the WFS-T export is the POST URL for the
		WFS Transaction operation. The <i>hale製tudio</i> user interface provides a helper to
		determine that URL from the WFS capabilities.</p>
