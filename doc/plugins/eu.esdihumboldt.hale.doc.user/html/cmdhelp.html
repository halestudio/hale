	<h1>Using Command Prompt to Transform</h1>
	<p>
	This Help section is about performing transformation of source data 
	using the (windows) command prompt/shell. If using another command 
	shell, try to use suitable commands.
	</p>
	<h2>Preparations</h2>
	<p>
	In order to use the command prompt to transform source data into 
	transformed data, you will need the recent HALE application on 
	your machine and the following things:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>An existing HALE Project</li>
		<li>The source data, that matches the source schema of the project</li>
		<li>A (path+)filename and file format for the transformed data</li>
		<li>Additional to the file format you will need a corresponding 
		target/output provider or a preset.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>To 1.</h3>
		<p>You will need a path to an existing HALE Project, either *.halez or *.zip, with 
		loaded source and target schema and a mapping between them. 
		These Information are used to perform the transformation.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>C:\Hale-Project\myProject.halez, for an absolute path.</li>
			<li>.\myProject.halez, for relative path to project in
			same folder your command prompt is currently focused and not the 
			location of the application.</li>
			<li>If the project name contains any space or interpretable 
			characters you have to use quotes "C:\Hale-Project\my Project.halez".</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>To 2.</h3>
		<p>The source data need to be one of the supported file formats. 
		The same rules as for project path applies to source data path. 
		See 1. If the HALE application can identify the file's format 
		and no additional parameter are required to read the source data 
		you can omit the source reader. See source reader for further 
		information on this topic. 
		</p>
	<h3>To 3.</h3>
		<p>You can use any path like 1. and 2., but you also have to use 
		one supported target file format. The file do not have to exist.</p>
	<h3>To 4.</h3>
		<p>You have to use either a target writer through a providerId or a 
		preset through its name. See target writer for further 
		information on this topic. </p>
		
	<h3>Info on path and file names</h3>
	<p>You can use relative path and spaces inside the path and/or filename. 
	But you have to notice that the relative path is the location your command 
	prompt is currently at and that you have to use quotes if there are any 
	spaces.</p>
	
	<h3>Info on preset</h3>
	<p>There are standard presets or you can create a custom preset. To 
	create a custom preset you have to open your HALE project and export a 
	custom data export.</p>
	
	<h2>General use</h2>
	<div>
		Open a command prompt and change into the directory where the 
		HALE.exe is located.
		<br/>
		Than type <b>HALE -nosplash -console -application hale.transform</b> 
		to start the HALE application doing the transformation. <b>-nosplash</b> 
		suppresses the splash screen that would appear on start. 
		Use <b>-console</b> if you want to get feedback about the process. 
		<b>-application hale.transform</b> starts the transformation process.
		<br/>
		The hale.transform need some parameter. You will need the preparation 1.-4.
		<ul>
			<li>-project &ltfile-or-URI-to-HALE-project&rt</li>
			<li>-source &ltfile-or-URI-to-source-data&rt</li>
			<li>[optional] -providerId &ltID-of-source-reader&rt</li>
			<li>-target &lttarget-file&rt</li>
			<li>-providerId &ltID-of-target-writer&rt or<br/>-preset &ltname-of-export-preset&rt</li>
		</ul>
		Depending on the source reader and target writer you can or have to indicate 
		additional <b>seetings</b>.<br/>
		Eventually you can add <b>-stacktrace</b> thereby errors are shown and you 
		can add <b>-reportsOut &ltreports-file&rt</b> to store infos, warnings and 
		errors that are reported.
	</div>
	<h2>Example Command</h2>
	<p>Here is an example on how to use a command. There is a 
	HALE project named "toInspire.halez" which contains a source schema 
	and a mapping to the INSPIRE schema. The source data is contained 
	in the "geographicData.shp" (schapefile) file. The transformed 
	data should be stored as "inspireData.gml" and as GML (INSPIRE SptialDataSet) 
	file format. The source reader do not have to be declared and the 
	providerId for the target writer is "eu.esdihumboldt.hale.io.inspiregml.writer". 
	Alternative to the providerId the preset can be used and reads 
	as follows "INSPIRE SpatialDataSet".</p>
	<p>
	The whole command could be:<br/>
	<b>HALE -nosplash -console -application hale.transform 
	-project "C:\mapping projects\toInspire.halez" 
	-source "C:\source data\geographicData.shp" 
	-target "C:\target data\inspireData.gml" 
	-providerId eu.esdihumboldt.hale.io.inspiregml.writer</b>
	<br/>or<br/>
	<b>HALE -nosplash -console -application hale.transform 
	-project "C:\mapping projects\toInspire.halez" 
	-source "C:\source data\geographicData.shp" 
	-target "C:\target data\inspireData.gml" 
	-preset INSPIRE SpatialDataSet</b>
	</p>
