	<h1>Schema Explorer</h1>
	<p>
		The <i>Schema Explorer</i> allows you to view the structure of the
		source (left) and the target (right) schema in various ways and
		enables the definition of mappings between the elements of the
		schemas.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/schema_explorer.png" title="Schema Explorer"
			style="max-width: 100%">
	</div>
	<p>
		The top level elements in the schema explorer are the classes/types
		defined in the schema, which may be used in the mapping. When loading
		a schema <i>HALE</i> tries to determine this automatically, but you
		can also define manually, which types are relevant for your mapping.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each type has a set of properties. A property either has an associated
		property type or is a group of properties. Properties with a property
		type have a structure according to that type's definition, they may
		have a value and properties of themselves. Select a schema element and
		open the <i>Properties</i> view to display detailed information about
		it. For XML schemas this may include a description of the schema
		element, as provided as documentation in the schema.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/schema_properties.png"
			title="Schema element information in Properties view">
	</div>
	<p class="Note">
		Please note that the <strong>Properties</strong> view is a view for
		displaying information on any kind of selected object and doesn't
		refer to the term <strong>property</strong> as used in the context of
		schemas.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the <i>Schema Explorer</i>, additionally to the element name, the
		occurrence of a property element is displayed - provided that it
		doesn't occur exactly once. The blue text after the element name
		states the minimum and maximum occurrence of a property.
	</p>
	<p>If the name of a schema element is displayed in brackets, this
		indicates that the element represents a context defined on the
		original schema element. Depending on the nature of the context, a
		description may be displayed (brown colored text). The image below
		contains a small example, where two condition contexts are defined on
		a property.</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/condition_context.png"
			title="Condition contexts defined on a property"
			style="max-width: 100%"> <br>
	</div>
	<p>
		The icon displayed for a schema element represents its classification
		and may be augmented with additional information, e.g. pointing out
		that a property is mandatory. For a detailed listing please have a
		look at the <a href="../reference/schema_elements.html">Schema
			elements</a> reference.
	</p>
	<p>In addition, the background color of a schema element indicates
		its mapping status:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/not_mapped.png"></td>
			<td>Not mapped</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/mapped_explicitly.png"></td>
			<td>Mapped explicitly with a relation</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/mapped_implicitly.png"></td>
			<td>Mapped implicitly due to the mapping of a sub-property</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/augmented.png"></td>
			<td>Value assignment independent of the source schema</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>The tool bar atop each schema viewer allows to filter the schema
		elements according to their classification. You can also enter a
		filter string, to search for types or properties with certain names.</p>
	<p class="Note">Please note that in complex schemas searching
		schema elements using a filter string is restricted to eight levels
		deep, to maintain an acceptable feedback time. If the schema contains
		cycles, the search result may still go deeper than eight levels.</p>
