	<h1>Schema Explorer</h1>
	<p>
		The <i>Schema Explorer</i> allows you to view the structure of the
		source (left) and the target (right) schema in various ways and
		enables the definition of mappings between the elements of the
		schemas.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/schema_explorer.png" title="Schema Explorer"
			style="max-width: 100%">
	</div>
	<p>
		The top level elements in the schema explorer are the classes/types
		defined in the schema, which may be used in the mapping. When loading
		a schema <i>hale»studio</i> tries to determine this automatically, but you
		can also define manually, which types are relevant for your mapping.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each type has a set of properties. A property either has an associated
		property type or is a group of properties. Properties with a property
		type have a structure according to that type's definition, they may
		have a value and properties of themselves. Select a schema element and
		open the <i>Properties</i> view to display detailed information about
		it. For XML schemas this may include a description of the schema
		element, as provided as documentation in the schema.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/schema_properties_update.png"
			title="Schema element information in Properties view" class="fit">
	</div>
	<p class="Note">
		Please note that the <strong>Properties</strong> view is a view for
		displaying information on any kind of selected object and doesn't
		refer to the term <strong>property</strong> as used in the context of
		schemas.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <i>Properties</i> view can also be used to view the values occurring within the selected
		property. Navigate to the schema element which contains values in the <i>Schema explorer</i> and select the <i>Occurring values</i> tab
		in the <i>Properties</i> view. Click the icon with arrows to display the unique values occurring in the data. The numbers in brackets indicate the frequency of occurrence.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/occurring_values.png"
			title="Occurring values in Properties view" class="fit">
	</div>
	<p>
		In the <i>Schema Explorer</i>, additionally to the element name, the
		occurrence of a property element is displayed - provided that it
		doesn't occur exactly once. The blue text after the element name
		states the minimum and maximum occurrence of a property.
	</p>
	<p>If the name of a schema element is displayed in brackets, this
		indicates that the element represents a context defined on the
		original schema element. Depending on the nature of the context, a
		description may be displayed (brown colored text). The image below
		contains a small example, where two condition contexts are defined on
		a property.</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/condition_context.png"
			title="Condition contexts defined on a property"
			style="max-width: 100%"> <br>
	</div>
	<p>
		The icon displayed for a schema element represents its classification
		and may be augmented with additional information, e.g. pointing out
		that a property is mandatory. For a detailed listing and more detailed
		information about how schema elements are represented in the
		application, please have a look at the <a
			href="../reference/schema_elements.html">Schema elements</a>
		reference.
	</p>
	<p>In addition, the background color of a schema element indicates
		its mapping status:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/not_mapped.png"></td>
			<td>Not mapped</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/mapped_explicitly.png"></td>
			<td>Mapped explicitly with a relation</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/mapped_implicitly.png"></td>
			<td>Mapped implicitly due to the mapping of a sub-property</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/augmented.png"></td>
			<td>Value assignment independent of the source schema</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>There are light and dark variants of the background colors for
		properties. The darker background stands for a direct mapping of the
		property, while properties with the light background color are mapped
		indirectly through inheritance.</p>
	<p>The tool bar atop each schema viewer allows to filter the schema
		elements according to their classification. You can also enter a
		filter string, to search for types or properties with certain names.</p>

	<h2>Display modes</h2>
	<p>
		In the <i>Schema Explorer</i> you can choose between two different
		modes for displaying the types contained in the schemas:
	</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/flat_hierarchy.png"></td>
			<td>All types are displayed in a flat list, children of types are properties of the type.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/inheritance_hierarchy.png"></td>
			<td>Types are displayed by the inheritance hierarchy. Sub-types
				are children of their super-types, in addition to the super-types'
				properties.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>Using the filter buttons in the view bar, you can show or hide
		certain properties in the schema types:</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/empty.gif"></td>
			<td>Properties that have values in the currently loaded data</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/inherited.gif"></td>
			<td>Properties that are inherited from a super type.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>Hiding the inherited properties, in combination with displaying
		the types according to their hierarchy, is very useful for analyzing
		the type hierarchy. The images below show the INSPIRE
		HydroPhysicalWaters schema with the types as list (left) and the types
		arranged according to the hierarchy and only displaying properties
		that are not inherited (right).</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/schema_list.png"></td>
			<td><img src="images/schema_hierarchy.png"></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
