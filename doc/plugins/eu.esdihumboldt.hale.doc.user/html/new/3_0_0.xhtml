<title>What's new in hale studio 3.0?</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>What's new in hale studio 3.0?</h1>
	<p>
		It's time for a new major release, and it does come packed with many
		new features and improvements. First, you might notice the new name
		and the new logo. <em>HALE</em> by itself was always hard to find with
		search engines and there is lots of other software called hale. Also,
		we've started to build a full data design and integration platform,
		and needed to diversify naming. HALE is thus now officially hale
		studio - but otherwise it remains the same!
	</p>

	<p>So, which major changes does this new release bring?</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Create Custom transformation functions and use them across projects</li>
		<li>Write more powerful Groovy/Custom Functions with Collectors, new helper functions and multiple target support</li>
		<li>Define Priorities for type cells</li>
		<li>Define Project variables</li>
		<li>Automate processes with a much improved Command Line Interface</li>
		<li>Read MS Access (*.mdb) databases</li>
		<li>Validate XLinks</li>
		<li>Control Polygon Winding Order for GML output</li>
		<li>Use Project Generators</li>
		<li>Use Documentation Generators</li>
		<li>Improved Transactional WFS support</li>
		<li>Use any reference map</li>
		<li>... and many more...</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The majority of these new features were made possible through our contracts with more than 20 customers. We'd like to thank you all for your support!</p>

	<p class="Note">As this is a major release, projects created with
		hale studio 3.0 may be incompatible with previous versions of HALE.</p>

			<tr id="custom-transformation">
				<td class="title">Custom transformation functions</td>
				<td class="content">HALE has had support for Groovy scripts for
					type and property transformation, but individual scripts couldn't
					be re-used. With custom transformation functions, you can define
					your own functions using Java or Groovy and re-use them throughout
					multiple mappings or even multiple projects.
					<p>
						<img src="3_0_0_images/custom-functions.png" />
					</p>
					<p>
						The current implementation of Custom Functions allows you to
						define input parameters and input/output data structures. In the
						function editor, you can use lots of helper functions to quickly
						get results. Please see the <a
							href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/tasks/alignment/define_custom_function.html">help
							on custom transformation functions</a> for more information on how to
						define and use custom transformation functions.

			<tr id="new-groovy-features">
				<td class="title">New Groovy Function Features</td>
				<td class="content">Groovy Functions help when the functions we
					ship with hale studio don't match specific requirements. To make
					them more powerful, we have added several new capabilities. The
					first of these is to output multiple features from a single Groovy
					Retype, Groovy Merge or Groovy Join function. You can use this
					functionality to create multiple partial feature from one large
					feature, or to create copies of a feature in the target data set.
					<p>
						The second improvement we've added are <strong>Collectors</strong>.
						When you declare a collector, you tell hale that it should create
						a list of all objects it creates during transformation, for later
						access in this or another Groovy function. You can use this for
						post-processing of objects, or to easily create references from a
						large object, such as as
						<code>TransportNetwork</code>
						, to small objects, such as
						<code>TransportLinks</code>
						.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="3_0_0_images/new-groovy-features.png" />
					</p>
					<p>We have also added several new helper functions, in
						particular for working with geometries. These helper functions
						allow you to create, find, split or combine geometries.</p>

			</tr>

			<tr id="project-variables">
				<td class="title">Project Variables</td>
				<td class="content">Sometimes you need to use a value in
					multiple functions that is a constant during one execution of the
					alignment, but might need to be changed later on, such as a dataset
					identifier. So far you'd have to modify all functions that use the
					constant value. Now, you can just define a global project variable
					and use that in many functions, such as <code>Formatted String</code>
					and in all Groovy Functions.
					<p>
						<img src="3_0_0_images/project-variables.png" />
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also set Project variables through the updated hale
						command line interface. Please see the <a
							href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/concepts/project_vars.html">project
							variables help</a> for more information.

			<tr id="powerful-map-view">
				<td class="title">Use any Basemap you want</td>
				<td class="content">When MapQuest stopped providing access to
					their nice tile services, that came as a surprise. We decided to
					not just drop in a new basemap like OSM Tiles, but insted improved
					the Map View. While we've set the new Stamen Terrain map as the
					defualt basemap, you are now free to configure any WMS-based or
					Tile-based map. Check the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user.views.styledmap/html/map_view.html">Map View help</a> for
					more instructions on how to configure basemaps.

					</p>
					<p>
						A big thanks to <a href="http://www.igd.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer
							IGD's Competence Center GEO</a>, who contributed the CityServer3D Map
						View to make these improvements possible.

			<tr id="ms-access-reader">
				<td class="title">Read MS Access Databases</td>
				<td class="content">MS Access databases are one of the most
					common formats used in reporting and statistics. In hale studio,
					you can now use MS Access databases to load source schemas and
					source data.
					<p>Thanks to the European Environmental Agency for funding this
						work.</p>

			<tr id="inspire-compliance-improvements">
				<td class="title">Improved Compliance with INSPIRE guidance</td>
				<td class="content">All GML writers now have an option to
					control and unify the winding order of any closed rings. You can
					either leave rings as they are, or unify them to clockwise or
					counter-clockwise winding order, with the latter being required for
					GML 3.2 and 3.3. The algorithm we employ takes into account axis
					order and direction, and reverses order for each level of inner
					rings. Furthermore, we have added an Xlink validator to make sure
					all <code>href</code> properties with local references point to
					valid resources.
					<p>Thanks to the European Environmental Agency for funding this
						work.</p>

			</tr>
			
			<tr id="interactive-documentation">
				<td class="title">Much improved Interactive Documentation</td>
				<td class="content">The interactive alignment documentation is
					really helpful to get input from domain experts on an alignment.
					During several major projects this year, we've seen it being used a
					lot and have improved it according to the feedback. In particular,
					even very large alignments with hundreds of cells can now be
					displayed, they can be searched and filtered, and much more.
