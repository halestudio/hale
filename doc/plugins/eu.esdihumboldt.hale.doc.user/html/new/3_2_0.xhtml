				<td class="title">Arc geometries</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						Until now, hale didn't support geometries with non-linear interpolation 
						between points, such as arcs. We now added a robust interpolation method 
						that processes <em>Arc</em>s, <em>ArcString</em>s, <em>Circle</em>s, 
						<em>CircleByCenterPoint</em>s and creates regular <em>LineStrings</em> 
						and <em>Polygons</em>.

							Geobasisinformation Rheinland-Pfalz</i> for funding this work.

			<tr id="multiple-validators">
				<td class="title">Multiple validators</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						hale studio's feature to validate exported XML and GML files has
						been extended. It is now possible to configure multiple validators.
						Furthermore, a new type of validator, the <em>Project validator</em>
						has been added which allows validation of the export result based
						on rules and schemas (e.g. Schematron schemas) imported into the 
						project.

			<tr id="wfs-pagination">
				<td class="title">WFS request pagination support</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						When loading from WFS sources, hale studio now supports request 
						pagination, a capability that was introduced with the WFS 2.0 standard.
						This allows loading larger datasets from a WFS where previously this
						may have been limited by a server-side limit of retrievable features
						per request.

			<tr id="variable-ui-support">
				<td class="title">Better UI support for project variables</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						The use of project variables, a feature that was introduced with hale 
						studio 3.0, is now easier as several wizards in hale studio have been
						extended to provide content assistance. Simply press Ctrl+Space when
						inside a text field and choose the desired variable from a list. The
						content assistant will take care of the correct syntax.
