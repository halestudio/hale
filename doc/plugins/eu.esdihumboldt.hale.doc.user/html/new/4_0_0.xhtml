		For a full list of changes, please check out the <a
			href="https://github.com/halestudio/hale/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400"
			target="_blank">changelog on GitHub</a>
	</p>

	<p>To avoid any compatibility issues when using an existing workspace, we recommend starting with a fresh one when you install
		hale»studio 4.0. Furthermore, due to the GeoTools &amp; JTS upgrade, the geometry bindings have changed.
		This breaks backwards compatibility of Groovy Scripts and Alignments created in 4.0.
		We will provide information on how you can manually backport your Groovy scripts if necessary.</p>

		<p>If you are a user of the <a
			href="https://www.wetransform.to/products/halestudiopro/"
			target="_blank">hale»studio pro</a> plugins, you need to upgrade these as well.
			Please reach out to the Servicedesk to get the new plug-ins.

					<p>
						<a href="https://www.geopackage.org/" target="_blank">GeoPackage</a> is the optimal, open format for delivering medium to large sized data sets to GIS users.
						It is a single file that can store tables, vector geometries and rasters. It is extensible and can deal with simple and more detailed
						data models well. There is even the option to add views and to store styles in a GeoPackage.
						It doesn't have issues such as 11 character attribute limits, unknown encodings, missing or incomplete projection files, and is very fast to access.
					</p>
					<p>
						For these reasons, there have been several requests to add GeoPackage to the list of supported formats for hale»studio.
						We have now added a Reader and a Writer. The Writer can create GeoPackages from scratch, including the schema and metadata.
						This means you can even use an XML schema and then write your data to a GeoPackage.
						However, the required model transformations to make this work in complex cases are planned for the next release.
					</p>

						This work was funded by the <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.at/" target="_blank">Umweltbundesamt Austria</a>
						and <a href="https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl/english" target="_blank">Rijkswaterstaat Netherlands</a>,

					<p>
						XPlanung is a standard for all kinds of spatial plans that is currently implemented by thousands of agencies all across Germany.
						To make the work with XPlanGML in hale»studio easier, we have added two features - Schema Presets for all relevant XPlanGML versions,
						and a writer that creates XPlanAuszug files without requiring manual configuration.
						This writer furthermore supports writing the data to one file per plan object - so you will get a file that has, for example the <code>BP_Plan</code>, the <code>BP_Bereich</code>
						and all directly or indirectly referenced objects.
