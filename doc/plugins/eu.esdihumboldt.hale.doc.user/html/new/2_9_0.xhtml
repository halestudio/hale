<title>What's new in HALE 2.9?</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>What's new in HALE 2.9?</h1>
	<p>HALE 2.9 comes with some nice new features since the last
		release HALE 2.8.0 - among other things a free configurable command
		line interface for transformation, improved INSPIRE support and some
		bug fixes.</p>

	<p class="Note">Please note that projects created with HALE 2.9 in
		some cases may be incompatible with previous versions of HALE. This is
		because the project file format has been extended, but the project
		file parser in HALE 2.8 and earlier is very strict and fails if it
		encounters anything unknown.</p>

	<!-- 2.9.1 -->
	<h2 id="2_9_1_Header">2.9.1</h2>
	<p>HALE 2.9.1 is a maintenance release with a few tweaks and bug
		fixes, but also some experimental features that were added.</p>

					used the command line interface part of the integration with the

					new command line interface is far more flexible in its
					configuration and allows data export to be easily configured with
					support through the HALE user interface. HALE plug-ins and
					extensions offering additional data format or validation support
					can be used with minimal effort.

					function now again is a pure augmentation, that has no connection
					to the source schema. Instead there now is an additional function <i>Assign
						(Bound)</i> that requires a source schema element as anchor. This
					doesn't break any existing mappings, existing assigns will be

					and a version of HALE that runs on current Mac OS X operating
