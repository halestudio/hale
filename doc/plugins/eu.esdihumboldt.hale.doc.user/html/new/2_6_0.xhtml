	<h1>What's new in HALE 2.6</h1>
	<p>These are the descriptions of some of the more interesting or
		significant changes made to HALE for the 2.6.0 release since the last
		stable release 2.5.0.</p>

				<td class="content" colspan="1" rowspan="1">For the mapping not
					only the schema is relevant, but what data it actually is populated
					with. Analyse the loaded source data using the new <i>Occurring
						values</i> section in the <i>Properties</i> view. It will appear for
					any selected schema property (even with a context defined) that
					holds simple values like strings, dates or numbers. Retrieving the
					occurring values has to be triggered manually, but you will get a
					list of all values together with the respective number of occurrence.

				<td class="title" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Schema by hierarchy</td>
				<td class="content" colspan="1" rowspan="1">In the <i>Schema
						Explorer</i> it is now possible to arrange the types in a schema by
					their hierarchy. This is especially handy for defining relations on
					super types. Furthermore, there is a new option to hide all
					properties that are introduced by inheritance. Thus you can easily
					analyze the schema and its type hierarchy.

				<td class="content" colspan="1" rowspan="1">It can be tedious
					in a large mapping to look for a specific relation you want to
					inspect or edit. Now you can use the <i>Mapping</i> view to show
					mappings related to specific schema elements - just select the
					element in the <i>Schema Explorer</i> and open the mapping view.
					Mappings on sub-properties of the element will be shown as well, if
					you enable it in the <i>mapping</i> view.

				<td class="content" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Due to the extended
					mapping functionalities that have been added in this version, a few aspects of how you work with mappings in the <i>Alignment</i>
					view have changed. Most important is the selection of the context
					of the mapping cells that are actually displayed. By default (no
					selection) the type relations will be displayed, but you can also
					focus on relations applicable in context of specific type relations
					or certain source or target types.

				<td class="content" colspan="1" rowspan="1">If you create

					evaluated, and so on.

			<tr id="inheritance">
				<td class="title" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Inherited property relations</td>
				<td class="content" colspan="1" rowspan="1">The type hierarchy in
					source and target schema can be exploited to create mappings faster
					and with minimal redundancy. Relations you create between
					properties of specific types apply as well for their sub-types -
					and even for conditions applied to the type. The image below shows an example type hierarchy displayed in the <i>Schema
						Explorer</i>.
					<p>
						<img src="2_6_0_images/inherit.png" />
					</p>
					<p>
						In the example, relations defined on properties of
						<code>River</code>
						will also be applied for the two type condition contexts of
						<code>River</code>,
						relations on properties of <code>_Feature</code> will be applied to
						the corresponding properties of <code>River</code>
						and the two contexts as well. In the <i>Alignment</i> view, inherited relations are marked with an upward arrow (<img src="2_6_0_images/inherited.png" />).

					imported as base alignment into the current project. The mappings defined in
					the base alignment will appear as part of the project's alignment
					in addition to the mappings defined therein. Base alignment
					mappings cannot be edited or deleted, but you can disable them if needed.

					is the ability to export XML to XML mappings to XSLT 2.0 scripts.
					The exported scripts can be used to transform data independently of
					HALE. The XSLT export supports a different set of functions than
					the built-in HALE transformation. When targeting XSLT for the
					transformation, use the corresponding compatibility mode. Change to
					the compatibility mode any time to see if your mapping is
					compatible with the XSLT export.
