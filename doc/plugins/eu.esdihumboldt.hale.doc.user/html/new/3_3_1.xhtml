					<p>
						<em>hale studio</em> extends its integration with the online
						collaboration platform  by allowing to save projects directly to
						<i>hale connect</i>. This allows for a true <i>online</i> workflow
						where your changes to a project that was saved to or loaded from
						<i>hale connect</i> will be saved directly to the remote project
						without the need of another export. You can switch back to an
						<i>offline</i> workflow at any time by saving your project to 
						a local file on your computer.

						When exporting data as GML, the exported data can now be partitioned

						be configured during the export.
