				<td class="title">Improved <i>hale»connect</i> integration</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						This release of <em>hale»studio</em> improves the integration
						with the online collaboration platform <i>hale»connect</i> in
						a couple of ways. Firstly, it is now possible to select which
						organisation should own an uploaded transformation project for
						cases where the currently logged-in user is member of more than
						one organisation. Furthermore, <em>hale»studio</em> now supports
						a relogin with same or different credentials without having to
						clear the credentials stored in preferences.

			<tr id="crs-dialog">
				<td class="title">Enhanced CRS selection dialog</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
					    When loading source data, the user is prompted to provide the 
					    CRS of the contained coordinates. <em>hale»studio</em> now 
					    facilitates this by providing the content of the <em>srsName</em>
					    attribute (in case of a GML source) or the WKT definition found
					    in the projection file (<i>.prj</i>) that accompanies a Shape 
					    file. This allows the user to select the correct CRS without
					    having to manually look up this information in the source files.

			<tr id="shp-charset-detection">
				<td class="title">Character set detection for Shapefiles</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						Importing a schema or source data from a Shapefile requires
						the user to select the encoding of the Shapefile. In cases
						where the Shape is accompanied by a Codepage file (<i>.cpg</i>),
						<em>hale»studio</em> can now read the encoding from that file
						a prefill the character set selection dialog. 
					</p>

			<tr id="context-cql">
				<td class="title">Support for CQL functions in filter contexts</td>
				<td class="content">
					<p>
						(E)CQL doesn't just contain simple operators, but also a large set 
						of functions that can be applied to any operand in any place where 
						hale studio enables the use of such filters:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Condition contexts on source schema elements</li>
						<li>Filters on source and target data table views</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Filter functions can be used to build expressions such as
						<tt>strToLowerCase(VALUE) like '%m%'</tt>. They also simplify 
						many expressions, e.g. through functions such as 
						<tt>IN(val1, val2, ...)</tt>, which needed an <tt>OR</tt> chain 
						of comparisons so far, or <tt>between(val, low, high)</tt> statements. 
						It is even possible to use spatial functions to filter by the spatial 
						relationship - <tt>contains(geomA, geomB)</tt> will return <tt>true</tt>
						when <tt>geomA</tt>contains <tt>geomB</tt>.
