	<h1>What is an Instance?</h1>
	<p>The term instance is used in the context of data according to a
		schema. As a schema defines a set of data types, an instance is a data
		object of a certain type.</p>
	<p>
		As an example, given a type <i>person</i> defined in a schema,...
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/instance_type.png">
	</div>
	<p>...an instance of the type has data structured according to the
		type definition, for instance as in the example below:</p>
	<div>
		<img src="images/instance.png">
	</div>
	<p>
		When loading a source data set in <i>HALE</i>, the data is partitioned
		into instances. Those instances can be inspected in the <a
			href="../views/source_data.html">Source Data</a> view. When a
		mapping/alignment is defined, the transformation is executed on the
		source instances, creating a data set of transformed instances
		according to the mapped target types. These instances in turn can be
		inspected in the <a href="../views/transformed_data.html">Transformed
			Data</a> view.
	</p>
