	<h1>What is an Alignment?</h1>
	<p>The alignment is the mapping between source and target schemas.
		It defines relations between source and target entities (types or
		properties). Based on the defined relations a transformation is
		derived.</p>
	<p>
		Each relation is represented in the <i>Alignment</i> by a mapping <i>cell</i>.
		A <i>cell</i> specifies source and target entities, a relation
		function and possibly parameters for the function. In the image below
		a mapping cell is represented as it would be displayed in the <a
			href="../views/alignment.html">Alignment view</a>. In the example the
		type <i>t1</i> from the source schema is mapped to the type <i>person</i>
		in the target schema, the relation is represented by the <i>Retype</i>
		function.
