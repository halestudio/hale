	<h1>The HUMBOLDT project</h1>
	<p>HUMBOLDT, a European project within the 6th Framework Programme,
		focuses on the facilitation and support of cross-national
		harmonisation of spatial data.</p>
	<p>Within the HUMBOLDT project, the following goals were used to
		guide the scientific and implementation work:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Capturing domain knowledge / application-specific knowledge
			required for data harmonisation, including an enhanced formalization
			of the transformation between two conceptual schemas</li>
		<li>Supporting the definition of the information product (target
			schema, SRS, spatial extent, ...) to which the processed data needs
			to be transformed</li>
		<li>Handling of transformation needs as part of the overall
			processing of an information request</li>
		<li><b>Enhancement of the automation of the data
				harmonisation processes</b> (depending on the possibility of capturing
			the required knowledge and the availability of this knowledge)</li>
	</ol>

	</div>
	<p>As already indicated in the list of goals, a main aspect is the
		involvement and formalisation of human knowledge for the geodata
		harmonisation process. Mainly the knowledge of GI data integrators as
		well as GIS developers has to be captured. The creation of a target
		data model (e.g. from an INSPIRE data theme specification) and the
		analysis of available data sources have to involve application
		experts’ knowledge about data interpretation and GIS developers’
		know-how about data processing. The expertise of GI data integrators
		is required again when the mapping between source and target is
		specified.</p>
	<p>For this purpose, three main components were designed and
		implemented in HUMBOLDT to support the acquisition of users’ knowledge
		for data modelling and harmonisation as well as the subsequent
		execution of conceptual schema transformation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HUMBOLDT GeoModel Editor</li>
		<li>HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor</li>
		<li>HUMBOLDT Conceptual Schema Transformer</li>
	</ul>
	<p>While the HUMBOLDT GeoModel Editor supports the specification of
		source and target models, the HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor facilitates
		the specification of the mapping between source and target, the
		HUMBOLDT service called Conceptual Schema Transformer is responsible
		for the execution of the transformation.</p>
