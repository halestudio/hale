	<h1>HALE - The HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor</h1>

	<p>The mapping of elements such as Feature Types and Attributes of
		one conceptual schema (e.g. GML Application Schemas, Database Schemas
		or UML models) to another is a cornerstone of data harmonisation. The
		HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor (HALE) is a tool for defining and evaluating
		conceptual schema mappings. HALE allows domain experts to create
		logically and semantically consistent mappings and to transform
		geodata based on these mappings. Furthermore, a major focus is put on
		the documentation of the schema transformation process and its
		impacts, e.g. in the form of lineage information attached to the
		resultant transformed data.</p>

	<p>HALE uses a high-level language for expressing the mappings.
		They can later be used by the Conceptual Schema Transformer processing
		component to execute a data transformation, e.g. from a non-harmonised
		data source to a INSPIRE-compliant data set.</p>

	<p>To make this complex process more accessible to domain experts
		and to increase the quality of the transformations, HALE allows
		working with sample geodata (instances) for visualization and
		validation.</p>

	<p>The value that HALE provides to data custodians, i.e.
		maintainers of geographic datasets, is manifold:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>HALE provides a unique declarative approach to making
			interactive schema mapping a less daunting task;</li>
		<li>HALE is based on a powerful conceptual-level mapping paradigm
			that makes mappings easier to understand and to maintain;</li>
		<li>HALE makes use of both the information in different
			conceptual schemas and of geographic instances to ensure high-quality
			mappings;</li>
		<li>HALE provides a rich, textual and graphical interface
			specifically adopted for GI Experts;</li>
		<li>HALE gives instant feedback about the progress of mapping
			data from one schema to another, enabling throughout understanding of
			the transformation process;</li>
		<li>HALE enables collaborative creation of mappings;</li>
		<li>With HALE, users can furthermore document known limitations
			of the mapping they are creating in the form of a unique Mismatch
			Description Language.</li>
