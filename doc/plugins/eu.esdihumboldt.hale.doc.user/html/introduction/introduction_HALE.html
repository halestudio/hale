	<h1>The HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor</h1>
	<h2>What can HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor do for you?</h2>
	<p>The HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor, short HALE, is a rich graphical
		user interface for defining mappings between concepts in conceptual
		schemas (application schemas created with the HUMBOLDT Model Editor or
		other modelling applications), as well as for defining transformations
		between attributes of these schemas. These mappings are expressed in a
		high level language called Ontology Mapping Language (OML) and can
		later be used by the Conceptual Schema Transformer processing
		component to generate an executable form of transformation, such as an
		XSLT for XML input/output.</p>

	<p>
		To make the mapping process more accessible to a domain expert and to
		increase the quality of transformations, <i>HALE allows working
			with sample source geodata for interactive visualization and
			validation.</i> Furthermore, a task-based system as it is often used in
		programming <i>supports users in the creation of a mapping.</i> HALE
		also provides other innovative capabilities, such as the <i>real-time
			evaluation of the mappings</i> you create in terms of their quality.
		Finally, HALE also contains a system that can be used to <i>document
			the validity of mappings.</i>

	<h2>Supporting Data harmonisation</h2>
	<p>The HUMBOLDT Alignment Editor is a core part of the HUMBOLDT
		Harmonisation toolkit. HALE (and the component executing your
		specified mappings, called the Conceptual Schema Translation Service
		CST) allows you to resolve several different interoperability issues:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Application schema and Terminology
			<ul>
				<li>Mapping rules for the classes and attributes of a source to
					a target conceptual schema</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Metadata
			<ul>
				<li>Mapping rules for metadata elements</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Spatial and temporal aspects
			<ul>
				<li>Definition of functions for transformation of geometric
					types</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Multiple representations
			<ul>
				<li>Definition of rules for handling other representations of
					the same object, i.e. under which circumstances which precedence
					should be used.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Terminology</h2>
	<p>
		The term <i>alignment</i> refers to the complete set of relationships
		defined between two conceptual schemas. A <i>mapping</i> is an
		individual relationship between entities of the source and the target
		schema. A <i>conceptual schema</i> is the model used for a data set
		and can be expressed in a different conceptual schema languages, such
		as a GML Application Schema, as an XML Schema (XSD), as a UML model or
		as a SQL DDL. Even shapefiles contain a simple model for attributive
		data. Please note that throughout this documentation, the term <i>FeatureType</i>
		is used synonymously to Spatial Object Type (INSPIRE wording) and
		Concept (Ontology Engineering). <i>Attribute</i> and <i>Property</i>
		are used synonymously. Both refer to elements of a type definition,
		sometimes also called fields. Usually, a Property represents a complex
		field, i.e. one that is not of a primitive type such as a String or
		number.
