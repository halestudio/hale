	<h1>The data harmonisation panel</h1>

	<p>From April 2011 on, after the end of the HUMBOLDT project, the
		development of HALE has been coordinated under the auspices of the
		data harmonisation panel. The data harmonisation panel has been
		established with the goal of supporting the international community of
		experts and organisations that have to deal with spatial data
		harmonisation by disseminating, exploiting and advancing harmonisation
		methods and technologies such as the tools and services developed in
		the HUMBOLDT project.</p>

	<p>Join the data harmonisation panel in these activities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Advancement of the cooperation among the stakeholders of
			geo-data harmonisation, including standardisation efforts</li>
		<li>Research of current developments and trends in the data
			harmonisation field, including market analysis</li>
		<li>Continued maintenance, development, and exploitation of
			state-of-the-art tools and services of HUMBOLDT</li>
		<li>Support of the development of the European Spatial Data
			Infrastructure as planned by INSPIRE</li>
		<li>Transfer of expertise into different application domains such
			as Security, Environment and Disaster Management.</li>
	</ul>
