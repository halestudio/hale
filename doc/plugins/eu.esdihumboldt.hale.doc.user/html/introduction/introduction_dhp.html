	<h1>wetransform</h1>

	<p>In 2015, wetransform took over the responsibility to develop and support the open source ETL tool <i>hale»studio</i>. Before that, the development was mostly financed through EU projects such as HUMBOLDT, which enabled rapid development.
		Since wetransform took over, we’ve been able to support thousands of users in using <i>hale»studio</i> to harmonise their data and to comply with many national and international standards, be it for e-Reporting, INSPIRE, CityGML, NAS or XPlanGML.
		Also, we continue to be pleasantly surprised by the kind of problems people solve using <i>hale»studio</i>.</p>

	<p>wetransform is a Fraunhofer spin-off established in 2015. Our mission is to "Make Open Standards work" for data exchange.
		Through the unique <i>hale»studio</i> data harmonisation technology and our <i>hale»connect</i> cloud platform, we make spatial and environmental data accessible and usable and thus provide the foundation for data ecosystems around topics such as Environmental Reporting, UAV Flight Zone Management and Forest Transformation.</p>

	<p>We offer a wide range of services around data harmonisation for national and international standards and cover the whole process from transformation to publishing and quality assurance. Find out more on our website at <a
