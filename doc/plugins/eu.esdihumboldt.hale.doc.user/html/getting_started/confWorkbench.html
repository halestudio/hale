	<h1>Configuring your workbench</h1>
	<p>
		When you start <i>hale»studio</i> the first time, it will present you with
		the <i>First steps</i> welcome page. It offers you to load an existing
		project or to continue with the <a class="command-link"
			href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.openCheatSheet(cheatSheetId=eu.esdihumboldt.hale.ui.firststeps.firststepsCS)")'>
			<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png"
			alt="command link">Get started with hale»studio</a>
		guide. After choosing either of those options the welcome page is
		replaced with the <i>hale»studio</i> workbench. You can also close the
		welcome page manually.
	</p>
	<p>The workbench consists of</p>
	<ul>
		<li>perspectives and</li>
		<li>views</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A perspective is a group of views in the workbench window. One or more
		perspectives can exist in a single workbench window. Each perspective
		contains one or more views. You can customize a perspective by adding
		or removing views, the state will be saved when the application is
		closed, and restored on startup. To show a view not yet available in
		the perspective, use the <i>Window&nbsp;→&nbsp;Show view</i> menu. To
		switch between perspectives, use the perspective bar, which is located
		in the top right corner of the application, next to the application
		tool bar.
	</p>
	<p>A view is a visual component within the workbench. It is
		typically used to represent a certain aspect of the current project,
		displaying information and possibly also allowing to manipulate it.</p>
	<p>
		In the image below, the <i>Default</i> perspective is the current
		perspective, and the <i>Schema Explorer</i> view is active.
	</p>
	<div>
		<img src="workbench.png" title="hale studio workbench"
			style="max-width: 100%">
	</div>
	<p>
		The active view may provide a selection for the application, which is
		used as the context for commands (e.g. the <i>Delete</i> command if
		supported for the selected objects) or for displaying further
		information on the selected objects in another view (e.g. the <i>Properties</i>
		view).
	</p>
	<p>Each of the views can be resized by grabbing its border and then
		dragging the mouse cursor. Furthermore, every view can be maximized by
		double clicking on the view title or by clicking the window icon in
		the right upper corner of the view. To set a view back to normal, you
		can again double-click on its tab or click on the icon displaying
		multiple windows. It is also possible to rearrange views. Just click
		on the view title and drag the mouse cursor to the desired position in
		the workbench. You will see that it is possible to stack views over
		each other, but also to arrange them next to each other.</p>
	<p>
		When you find a view configuration that you like particularly well,
		you can save that configuration as a custom perspective. Again, go to
		the <i>Window</i> menu, pick <i>Save Perspective as</i>, and enter the
		name under which you want to store your perspective. The perspective's
		name will now appear in the upper right corner to indicate it is
		active and stored.
