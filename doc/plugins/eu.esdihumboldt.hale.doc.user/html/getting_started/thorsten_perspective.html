	<h1>Thorsten perspective</h1>
	<p>The Thorsten perspective is how Thorsten works most efficiently
		with hale»studio. He likes to have schemas, data and the alignment in his
		reach all the time. For creating the alignment he prefers an approach
		driven by sample data, so the data views and the map view play an
		important role in his favorite perspective.</p>
	<p class="Note">
		<strong>Tip: </strong>Everyone works differently - if you, like
		Thorsten, find that there is a certain setup you feel more efficient
		with, just save it as your own perspective. Go to the <i>Window</i>
		menu, pick <i>Save Perspective as</i>, and enter the name under which
		you want to store your perspective.

	<p>Following is a short description of the perspective's views:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <i>Schema Explorer</i> allows you to view the structure
			of the source (left) and the target (right) schema in various ways
			and to define mappings between the elements of the
			schemas.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Source Data</i> view displays samples of the loaded
			source data. A filter query can be used to control which instances
			are displayed.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Transformed Data</i> view displays samples of the
			transformed data. By default it is synchronized to the <i>Source
				Data</i> view and contains the transformation result of the instances
			represented there.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Map</i> view provides you with a cartographic
			representation of the data. Source and transformed data are displayed
			alongside each other, with different layouts to choose from. The map
			can be used to select instances for examination in the data views, or
			vice versa.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Alignment</i> view displays the current alignment per
			type relation and allows editing or removing mapping cells.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Properties</i> view displays information on the
			current selection, in the above image this is the explanation of the
			mapping cell selected in the active <i>Alignment</i> view.
		</li>
	</ul>
