<h2>Configuring your workbench</h2>
When you start HALE the first time, it will present you
with a user interface that contains several different
parts. These parts, called views, each have a specific
purpose. In the current release, the following views
are included:

<ul>
	<li><i>Schema Explorer:</i> The Schema Explorer allows
		you to view the structure of the source
		(left) and the target (right) schema in various
		ways and enables the definition of mappings
		between the elements of the schemas.</li>
	<li><i>Mapping View:</i> The mapping view provides
		information on the schema mappings you
		have defined on the elements currently selected
		in the Schema Explorer.</li>
	<li><i>Map View:</i> This view provides you with a
		cartographic representation of the reference
		data for the source schema and the transformed
		data alongside each other, when
		you have loaded such data. It can be styled
		and navigated interactively.</li>
	<li><i>Reference Data:</i> This view provides a tabular
		representation of the reference data for
		the source schema when you have loaded
		any.</li>
	<li><i>Transformed Data:</i> Like the Reference Data
		view, this view provides you with the possibility 
		to inspect transformed data.</li>
	<li><i>Tasks:</i> The Task View provides you with information
		on tasks that have to be completed
		to create a complete and correct
		mapping.</li>
	<li><i>Mapping Graph View:</i> This view gives you a
		graphical overview of the mapping created
		so far.</li>
	<li><i>Error Log:</i> Gives you insight into the program's
		log messages. They can be exported
		as log files to submit with a bug report.</li>
</ul>
Each of these views can be resized by grabbing its
border and then dragging the mouse cursor. Furthermore,
every view can be maximized by double clicking
on the "Folder" part of the view on top or by clicking
the bigger window icon on the right side of the
view's top. To set a view back to normal, you can
again double-click on its tab or click on the small window
icon.
It is also possible to rearrange views. Just click on
the tab and drag the mouse cursor to the place
