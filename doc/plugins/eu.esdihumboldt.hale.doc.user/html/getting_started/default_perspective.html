	<h1>Default perspective</h1>
	<p>The default perspective serves to explore the source and target
		schemas, to define relations between the schema elements and to view
		and manage the overall alignment.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Following is a short description of the perspective's views:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <i>Schema Explorer</i> allows you to view the structure
			of the source (left) and the target (right) schema in various ways
			and enables the definition of mappings between the elements of the
			schemas.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Alignment</i> view displays the current alignment per
			type relation and allows editing or removing mapping cells.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Properties</i> view displays information on the
			current selection, in the above image this is the explanation of the
			mapping cell selected in the active <i>Alignment</i> view.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Functions</i> view shows the available transformation
			functions, which can be used to define relations. Further information
			on a selected function will be displayed in the <i>Properties</i>
			view.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Type hierarchy</i> view allows to explore the
			hierarchy of a schema type, associated with the current selection in
			the <i>Schema Explorer</i>.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Report List</i> provides an overview of the last
			completed processes, e.g. loading a schema or performing a
			transformation, and their status.
		</li>
		<li>The <i>Error Log</i> gives you insight into the application's
			log messages. They can be exported as log files to submit with a bug
			report.
		</li>
		<!--li><i>Map View:</i> This view provides you with a cartographic
			representation of the reference data for the source schema and the
			transformed data alongside each other, when you have loaded such
			data. It can be styled and navigated interactively.</li>
		<li><i>Reference Data:</i> This view provides a tabular
			representation of the reference data for the source schema when you
			have loaded any.</li>
		<li><i>Transformed Data:</i> Like the Reference Data view, this
			view provides you with the possibility to inspect transformed data.</li>
		<li><i>Tasks:</i> The Task View provides you with information on
			tasks that have to be completed to create a complete and correct
			mapping.</li>
		<li><i>Mapping Graph View:</i> This view gives you a graphical
			overview of the mapping created so far.</li-->
	</ul>
