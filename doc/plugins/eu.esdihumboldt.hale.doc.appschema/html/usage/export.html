<title>GeoServer App-Schema Plug-in for <i>hale studio</i> - Export the App-Schema Configuration</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Export the App-Schema mapping configuration</h1>

	<p>
	The core functionality of the plug-in comes into play when the alignment is exported as an
	App-Schema mapping configuration.
	</p>

	<p>
	A complete App-Schema mapping configuration requires a number of files, the most important being
	<strong>the mapping file</strong>.<br>
	<a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/mapping-file.html" target="_blank">A mapping file</a> defines,
	for all mapped feature types, the data source and the mappings from the source data to XPaths in the output XML.
	The plug-in may split the mapping file in two: a main mapping file, named after the target schema, 
	where the definitions of top level feature types (i.e. types actually derived from <em>gml:AbstractFeatureType</em>, 
	which will be individually queryable via WFS) are stored, and a secondary file, always called <em>includedTypes.xml</em>,
	containing the mappings for non-feature types and <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/feature-chaining.html#multiple-mappings-of-the-same-type" target="_blank">alternative mappings</a>
	for the feature types configured in the main file.
	</p>

	<p>
	Additional details on the files required by an App-Schema configuration can be found
	<a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/configuration.html" target="_blank">here</a>
	and <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/secondary-namespaces.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	The export wizard comprises several steps, which will be described in this section.
	</p>

	<h2>Choosing an export format</h2>

	<p>The first step consists in choosing the export format.</p>

	<div style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/hale_align_export_format.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 512px"></div>

	<p>The options highlighted in the figure above represent two complementary export approaches:</p>

	<ol>
	<li><strong>App-Schema Configuration</strong>: the configuration is saved to one or more files, 
		which must be manually copied / extracted to the right place in the GeoServer data directory.
		This approach may be preferred during testing, or when a live GeoServer instance is not
		available or not accessible.<br>
		This option can be further differentiated based on the type of the generated file(s):
		<ul>
		<li><em>App-Schema Mapping File (*.xml)</em>: only the mapping file is generated (also the related
		<em>includedTypes.xml</em> is generated if necessary); this is useful when a working App-Schema
		data store configuration is already in place and only the mapping file needs to be updated</li>
		<li><em>App-Schema Config Archive (*.zip)</em>: the export will generate a ZIP archive containing
		all the required files (e.g. secondary namespaces, datastore.xml, featuretype.xml, etc...); the contents
		of the archive should be extracted in the <em>workspaces</em> folder under GeoServer's data directory.
		Currently, the exporter is unable to detect the SRS and the bounding box of the published layers,
		so the user will likely need to adjust these settings through GeoServer's web UI once the App-Schema
		configuration is in place.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>App-Schema Configuration [Direct Upload]</strong>: the configuration is generated and
		immediately uploaded to GeoServer via its <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/rest/examples/curl.html#uploading-multiple-app-schema-mapping-files" target="_blank">REST API</a>.
		This approach is more convenient and should generally be preferred. If this option is chosen,
		the wizard will also ask the user to specify the URL of the GeoServer instance to target
		(e.g. <em>http://localhost:8080/geoserver</em>) and credentials to access its REST services.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Including the target schema</h2>

	<div style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/hale_include_target_schema.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 512px"></div>

	<p>
	If the <em>Include target schema in the archive</em> option is checked, the imported target schema,
	including all its dependencies, will be added to the exported archive and uploaded to GeoServer
	along with the mapping configuration.
	</p>

	<p>
	This option may be useful when GeoServer is running on a server with no internet connectivity and
	is thus unable to download the required schemas from the web. However, in general it should be left
	unchecked, to maximize schema reuse among App-Schema datastores via GeoServer's centralized
	<a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/app-schema-resolution.html#cache" target="_blank">App-Schema cache</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Configuring Feature Chaining</h2>

	<p>
	If the alignment defines at least one <em>Join</em> relation, the wizard will ask the user to configure
	<a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/feature-chaining.html#feature-chaining" target="_blank">Feature Chaining</a>.
	Feature Chaining is the mechanism by which App-Schema builds up complex types by composing simpler components.
	For example, a <em>gsml:GeologicUnit</em> contains one or more <em>gsml:CompositionPart</em> instances,
	which are nested in its multi-valued <em>gsml:composition</em> property.
	</p> 

	<p>
	To chain components, App-Schema needs to know:
	<ol>
	<li>which field in the container and nested source types refer to each other (similar to a foreing
	key in a relational database)</li>
	<li>which (often multi-valued) property of the container target type will hold the instance(s) of the
	nested target type</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
	The hale Join relation does provide for 1., but not for 2. This is the reason why a additional configuration
	is required to make Feature Chaining function properly.
	</p>

	<p>
	The user will be presented with one configuration dialog for each join condition that was defined
	(even if the Join involves more than two types, Feature Chaining is always configured pair-wise).
	The figure below shows a sample chaining configuration dialog.
	</p>

	<div style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/hale_featchain_stage1_gsml.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 512px"></div>

	<p>
	The upper part of the dialog contains a read-only table displaying the current configuration, while
	the bottom part contains a schema explorer view, showing all the properties of the target type of
	the whole Join relation, and, further down, a checkbox.
	</p>

	<p>
	The table is composed of four columns:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Source Type</strong>: the name of the source type we are chaining / joining.</li>
	<li><strong>Role</strong>: specifies whether the source type should be nested into the other, or viceversa.
	The role is determined from the join order and cannot be modified: the join type in the condition
	has always the <em>NESTED</em> role, while the base type has always the <em>CONTAINER</em> role.</li>
	<li><strong>Join Property</strong>: the property that is checked for equality.</li>
	<li><strong>Target Type</strong>: the source type will be mapped to this type, i.e. a feature type
	mapping for it will be created in the App-Schema configuration.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	As the dialog is opened the first time, all cells in the table are filled automatically, except the nested
	type's target: that is what must be selected in the schema explorer view. In this example, the user
	navigated to the <em>gsml:GeologicUnit/gsml:composition/gsml:CompositionPart</em> property and clicked
	on it: the Target Type column in the second table row was populated with the value <em>gsml:CompositionPart</em>,
	as shown in the figure above. This configuration is telling GeoServer both that the <em>gsml_CompositionPart</em>
	source type should be mapped to the <em>gsml:CompositionPart</em> type, and that <em>gsml:CompositionPart</em>
	instances should be nested under the <em>gsml:composition</em> attribute of the <em>gsml:GeologicUnit</em> type.
	<br>It is worth noting that the selection is restricted to the mapping relevant target types. To learn
	how to edit the set of mapping relevant types, see <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/eu.esdihumboldt.hale.doc.user/html/tasks/schema/mapping_relevant.html">the this section</a> in the user guide.
	</p>

	<p>
	The <em>Generate unique mapping for nested target type</em> checkbox should be checked if one wants to
	provide <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/feature-chaining.html#multiple-mappings-of-the-same-type" target="_blank">alternative mappings for a target feature type</a>
	(e.g. different source types that should map to the same target type).
	</p>

	<p>
	Real world examples of complex Feature Chaining configurations can be found in the <a href="http://geoserver.geo-solutions.it/complexfeatures/index.html" target="_blank">Complex Features Training</a>
	by <a href="http://www.geo-solutions.it/" target="_blank">GeoSolutions</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Configuring the source data store</h2>

	<p>
	The App-Schema mapping file requires that data sources be specified in the <em>sourceDataStores</em> section.
	Although the GeoServer App-Schema extension supports a variety of data store types and multiple data
	store configurations, the <i>hale studio</i> App-Schema plug-in only allows to configure a single PostGIS data store.
	This limitation will likely be removed (or at least alleviated) in future releases of the plugin.
	</p>

	<p>
	A sample data store configuration dialog is depicted in the figure below.
	</p>

	<div style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/hale_datastore_conf_gsml.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 512px"></div>

	<p>
	The configuration settings should be pretty straight forward. However, it is worth mentioning that the
	<em>Expose primary keys</em> option must be checked if primary key columns are used in attribute mappings.
	</p>

	<h2>Providing REST credentials</h2>

	<p>
	If <em>App-Schema Configuration [Direct Upload]</em> was chosen as export format, the last configuration
	dialog in the export wizard will ask the user to provide credentials to access GeoServer's REST services.
	</p>

	<div style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;"><img src="../../images/hale_rest_credentials.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 512px"></div>
