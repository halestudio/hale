<title>GeoServer App-Schema Plug-in for HALE - HALE vs. App-Schema</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>HALE vs. App-Schema</h1>

	This section will go into more detail on points where the behavior of App-Schema differs from HALE's.

	<h2>Feature Type mappings</h2>

	<p>
	The core of App-Schema's mapping file is the definition of one or more Feature Type Mappings.
	Each Feature Type Mapping specifies the name of an element in the target application schema, which
	defines the target feature type name, and a set of Attribute Mappings, controlling how the properties
	of the target type will be populated from the source.
	</p>

	<p>
	Roughly speaking, <strong>the plug-in translates type relations to Feature Type Mappings and property
	relations to Attribute Mappings</strong>. The translation logic depends on the actual relation used.
	</p>

	<p>
	In particular:

	<ul>
	<li>A <strong>Retype</strong> or <strong>Merge</strong> relation is translated to a Feature Type
	Mapping with the same name as its target type's.</li>
	<li>A <strong>Join</strong> relation is translated to multiple Feature Type Mappings, one for each
	source type participating to the join. The target feature type is determined from the Feature Chaining configuration.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<a name="join"></a>
	<p>
	Note that a <strong>Join</strong> is handled differently in HALE and App-Schema:
	<ul>
	<li>In HALE, multiple source types are fused into a target type</li>
	<li>In App-Schema, each single source type is mapped to a different target type, then target types are
	further composed to form more complex types via feature chaining. In this way, each target feature type
	retains its identity and can be queried separately (via WFS, for example).</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	It is also worth mentioning that, although in HALE multiple join conditions can be specified for each source type,
	App-Schema only supports single-condition joins; thus, in order to be translateable to a GeoServer
	App-Schema configuration, an alignment should not contain more than one join condition for the same source type.
	<br>See the section on <a href="./export.html#chaining">Feature Chaining</a> for more details.
	</p>

	<p>
	Another limitation worth noting is that <strong>all target types must belong to the namespace
	of the target schema</strong>. For example, if the imported target schema is the <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/lcv/3.0/LandCoverVector.xsd" target="_blank">INSPIRE application
	schema for Land Cover Vector</a>, the target element of all generated Feature Type mappings must
	belong to the namespace <em>http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/lcv/3.0</em>.<br>
	This restriction stems from the fact that currently the alignment is translated to a single App-Schema
	mapping configuration, driving a single App-Schema data store, which in GeoServer must belong to
	a single namespace. This in practice means that all feature types served by the store must be in
	its namespace. This does <strong>not</strong> mean that attribute mappings cannot refer to types
	belonging to different namespaces: the restriction only applies to the feature types the store will
	serve.<br>
	The limitation may be removed in a future release.
	</p>

	<a name="id_merging"></a>
	<h2>Instance identity and merging</h2>

	<p>
	App-Schema determines the identity of a feature by looking at a special Attribute Mapping containing
	the <em>&lt;idExpression&gt;</em> directive, which defines a CQL expression that will be used to set the <strong>gml:id</strong>
	attribute of the feature (more details on this can be found in the <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/data/app-schema/mapping-file.html#idexpression-optional" target="_blank">official GeoServer documentation</a>).
	</p>

	<p>
	Note that <strong>source instances having the same gml:id are automatically merged by App-Schema</strong>. 
	The user can control the instance identity by defining a property relation that targets the <strong>gml:id</strong>
	attribute of the target feature type: the plug-in will translate it to the special <em>&lt;idExpression&gt;</em> directive, 
	rather than treating it as a regular attribute mapping. If no <em>&lt;idExpression&gt;</em> mapping is available,
	App-Schema will automatically generate a unique <strong>gml:id</strong> for each source instance.
	</p>

	<p>
	This is another important point where HALE and App-Schema differ:
	<ul>
	<li>In HALE, the number of target instances is a function of the relation between source and target
	types</li>
	<li>In App-Schema, the number of target instances is a function of the gml:id mapping</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	This is particularly relevant when translating an alignment that contains one or more <strong><em>Merge</em></strong> relations.
	To reproduce the same behavior in HALE and App-Schema, the user needs to construct the <strong>gml:id</strong> from
	a combination of the source properties configured as the properties to merge on in HALE (e.g. using
	a Formatted String transformation).
	</p>

	<h2>Mapping geometries</h2>

	<p>
	Special care should be taken when the target of a property relation is a geometry. For ordinary GML
	geometry properties (i.e. whose type inherits from <em>gml:GeometryPropertyType</em>), the mapping
	in both HALE and App-Schema is as simple as defining a <em>Rename</em> relation between the source
	property (be it a geometry column in a database, or a geometric attribute in a shapefile) and the
	target property.
	</p>

	<p>However, if the target geometry property is not a <em>gml:GeometryPropertyType</em>, in order to
	have the plug-in generate a working App-Schema mapping, the user must explicitly target the concrete
	geometry type contained in the geometry property. An example is the <em>gmd:EX_BoundingPolygon_Type</em>
	defined in the OGC Geographic MetaData (GMD) markup language, whose property <em>gmd:polygon</em>
	contains a geometry, but is not a <em>gml:GeometryPropertyType</em>. The correct target property to select
	here to encode e.g. a MultiPolygon would be <em>gmd:polygon/gml:AbstractGeometry/gml:MultiSurface</em>,
	and not simply <em>gmd:polygon</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
	Another point that deserves attention is the generation of GML IDs for geometries.
	In GML 3.x, all geometries must have a <strong>gml:id</strong> attribute, even though often its actual
	value is of no interest to the user. HALE satisfies this requirement by automatically generating
	GML IDs on data export. However, the App-Schema plug-in requires an explicit mapping for the geometry's
	<strong>gml:id</strong> attribute to generate a correct App-Schema configuration. This limitation
	will likely be removed in a future release.
	</p>

	<h2>Mapping nillable mandatory elements</h2>

	<p>
	There are cases when a complex type contains a lot of elements that are mandatory, but can be
	<em>nil</em>, i.e. have an attribute <em>xsi:nil="true"</em>. A famous example is <em>GeographicalNameType</em>,
	from the <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/schemas/gn/3.0/GeographicalNames.xsd" target="_blank">INSPIRE application schema Geographical Names</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
	If no mapping is present in the alignment for a nillable mandatory element, upon data export HALE
	automatically creates an empty element with an <em>xsi:nil="true"</em> attribute. On the contrary,
	App-Schema does not handle this situation automatically, but requires the user to explicitly map
	the <em>xsi:nil</em> attribute in the configuration file.
	</p>

	<p>
	The App-Schema plug-in for HALE strives to alleviate this nuisance by tuning the generated Attribute
	Mappings of nillable elements for which a mapping has been defined in the alignment. The tuning
	results in an <em>xsi:nil="true"</em> attribute being automatically added to the element when it has no value.
	</p>

	<p>
	However, this only applies to mapped elements. For nillable elements that do not participate in the
	alignment, the user is required to provide a mapping, to make the generation of the necessary
	App-Schema configuration possible. HALE does not allow to map the <em>xsi:nil</em> attribute directly,
	so the plug-in relies on the <em>nilReason</em> attribute: if a mapping exists for the <em>nilReason</em>
	attribute of a nillable element, the generated Attribute Mapping is altered so that an <em>xsi:nil="true"</em>
	attribute will appear on the element when a value exists for the <em>nilReason</em> attribute.
