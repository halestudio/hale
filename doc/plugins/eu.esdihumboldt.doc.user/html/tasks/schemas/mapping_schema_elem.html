<h2>Mapping schema elements</h2>

The main purpose of HALE is of course not to just inspect
schemas, but to map the elements of these
schemas with the goal of transforming corresponding
geodata sets.
To map types or attributes from the source schema
to type or attributes, you first have to select them in
the Schema Explorer. You can do any complex selection
in the Schema Explorer, such as selecting
three elements on the source side and one element
on the target schema side. To select multiple elements,
press the CTRL button while clicking on the
items. Using the CTRL button will also allow you to
deselect a schema item.
After selecting the source and target schema elements,
you can press the Arrow button in between
Source and Target Schema and then select an appropriate
function.
If you want to connect one feature type to another,
use "Retype Feature", which effectively allows to assign
instances of one type of the source schema to
one in the target schema. In addition, you can define
so-called instance splits and merges in this function.
After defining a Retype Feature mapping, you can
also apply a filter to it. Without changing the selection
to which you applied a transformation, click on the
"Mapping" button again and choose the CQL Filter
Wizard. Configure the expression as you would like
to have it, click "Finish", and you will now see a Filter
added in the Mapping View.
